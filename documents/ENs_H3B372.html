<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Remit</h2>
<p>On 19 May 2011, the Riksdag requested that the Government present proposals for new legislation on military equipment, with the aim of tightening controls on exports of military equipment to non-democratic countries. On 1 June 2012, the Government adopted terms of reference (ToR 2012:50) and appointed a parliamentary committee consisting of representatives of all the parties in the Riksdag.</p>
<p>The overall remit for the committee is to review the export controls on military equipment and make proposals regarding how the control system should be designed in the future. The remit includes:  Examining future Swedish export controls on military equipment and the regulatory framework surrounding these. The main purpose of the inquiry is to submit proposals for new military equipment legislation with the aim of tightening controls on exports to  non-democratic countries.  Proposing the factors that should be taken into consideration in order to establish whether or not a country is a democracy and that should form the basis for assessing applications for licences to export military equipment from Sweden.  Examining how the controls on the export of military equipment to  non-democratic countries will be tightened.  Examining the consequences of tightening controls on the export of military equipment to  non-democratic countries, for example the impact of the proposal on Sweden’s wider bilateral relations.  Examining what should be regarded in the future as  follow-on deliveries.  Study and survey export control systems in other partner countries, in particular their controls on the export of military equipment to  non-democratic countries.  Examining the possibility of improving openness and transparency in Swedish export controls.  Analysing and assessing whether military equipment legislation needs to be amended for clarification.  Describing how the joint position, the Swedish guidelines on military equipment exports and Sweden’s Policy for Global Development have been put into practice and whether this has changed over time.</p>
<p>In addition, the committee’s remit has included examining the suitability of introducing financial penalties into the Military Equipment Act and the Dual-use Items and Technical Assistance Control Act. The committee reported this remit in the interim report Sanktionsväxling – effektivare sanktioner på exportkontrollområdet  (Penalty-shift  – more effective sanctions in the area of export controls ) (SOU 2014:83), which was presented in December 2014.</p>
<p>With regard to the remit to report on the development of practice etc., the committee has turned to the Inspectorate of Strategic Products (ISP) and asked it to describe the situation in this area. There is no reason for the committee to present its own account alongside that provided by the ISP, as it would be mainly based on the agency’s account. In this respect, the committee has therefore chosen to present the ISP’s account in its entirety as an annex to this report.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Sweden has a domestic defence industry for security and defence policy reasons. The industry is dependent on authorisation of its activities by the Swedish Government as licences are required for the manufacture, supply and export of military equipment. A fundamental condition to be met for such a licence to be granted is that the Swedish Government has a need to do so in terms of security and/or defence policy.</p>
<p>Exports of military equipment have been regulated in law in Sweden since the First World War. Government controls have been developed, adapted and tightened over the course of time. The controls have been tightened both by increasing the number of products that have been controlled and by setting ever stricter requirements for licensing. With regard to the concept of export controls, it can be noted that it covers more than just monitoring and assessment of the actual export, i.e. when products and knowhow are exported from the country. Export controls include all the assessment and monitoring measures taken throughout the life cycle of the products, from manufacturing to border crossing and post-control at the recipient, both within Sweden and outside its borders. The ultimate purpose of export controls on military equipment can be said to be the political endeavour to make sure that the military equipment exported from Sweden goes to recipient countries acceptable to us.</p>
<p>Sweden has chosen to allow exports of military equipment to a certain extent for security, defence and foreign policy reasons. This trend has been reflected in Swedish legislation in an ever stricter set of rules. As well as exports of military equipment, export controls on military equipment cover the manufacture of military equipment, supply of military equipment and certain agreements on manufacturing rights etc. for military equipment. The controls apply both to equipment designed for military use and to technical support regarding military equipment that, according to the Government regulations, constitutes technical assistance.</p>
<h2>Applicable rules on export controls relating to military equipment</h2>
<p>Previously it was the Government that assessed all cases relating to export licences. Since 1996 almost all cases have been assessed by the administrative authority ISP. The ISP is a director-led agency, which means that it is the Director-General who is ultimately responsible for all decisions made by the authority. However, the Government retains the power to assess precedent-setting cases and cases of particular importance in order to consequently be able to manage the development of practice and adapt it to changing security, defence and foreign policy requirements. In some cases the ISP seeks the opinion of the Export Control Council (ECC). The ECC is a parliamentary advisory body for export control issues. The Council is appointed by the Government and consists of members representing all the parties with seats in the Riksdag. The recommendations made by the ECC on how a particular case should be assessed are not binding on the ISP or the Government. It is the Director-General of the ISP who decides which cases are to be handed over to the Government for a decision and in which cases the ECC is to be consulted. The Government can decide that certain types of cases are always to be handed over to the Government, for example that cases concerning a particular designated country or region are always to be handed over.</p>
<p>The Military Equipment Act contains a general ban on the manufacture, supply and export of military equipment and on the provision of technical assistance to anyone outside Sweden. The Act also states that such activity may be undertaken if a licence for that purpose is granted. Under the Military Equipment Act, licences may only be granted if there are security or defence policy reasons for doing so, and provided there is no conflict with Sweden’s foreign policy. This provision constitutes the fundamental condition to be met for the assessment of licence applications and indicates what the assessment should focus on. The provision was introduced into the Act at the time when the ISP was established in 1996.</p>
<p>The Government Bill which led to the formation of the ISP states that security, defence and foreign policy considerations are to be the decisive factor in assessing cases and that this is ensured by incorporating the provision mentioned into the Act. Beyond this overarching provision, the Act does not contain any further instructions on what is to be taken into account in assessing applications for licences. Guidance on assessing whether licences are to be granted can, however, be found in the Swedish guidelines on military equipment exports and other cooperation with foreign partners contained in the preparatory materials for the Military Equipment Act. These guidelines represent the principles that the Government has established in practice and that are to provide guidance in assessing applications for licences. The criteria in the EU’s Common Position on Arms Exports and the UN Arms Trade Treaty which Sweden has undertaken to comply with are also taken into account in this assessment.</p>
<p>The guidelines make a distinction between what are known as unconditional and conditional obstacles. Unconditional obstacles are obstacles that prohibit export despite the fact that export may be called for on the basis of defence or security policy considerations. It follows from the guidelines that such obstacles exist and that a licence must not be granted if this would contravene international agreements to which Sweden is a party, if this would contravene decisions by the UN Security Council or if this would contravene international law on exports from a neutral country during war. Other foreign policy obstacles that follow from the guidelines are what are known as conditional obstacles. Such an obstacle exists if widespread and gross violations of human rights occur in the recipient country, if the country has internal armed unrest or is in an armed conflict with another country or if such a risk exists. When a conditional obstacle is present, the guidelines stipulate that a licence should not be granted. In cases where there are no unconditional obstacles, an overall assessment should be made in which account is taken of all circumstances significant to the case. The guidelines can be said to be an instrument of balance where factors in favour of export must be weighed against factors militating against export. Thus, this means that a licence can be granted in a case even if conditional obstacles exist.</p>
<p>The guidelines distinguish between the two categories of military equipment: military equipment for combat purposes and other military equipment. The category of military equipment for combat purposes in principle consists of products with a destructive effect, while the category of other military equipment is made up of non-destructive products. In assessing applications for licences a distinction is made between military equipment for combat purposes and other military equipment, where stricter requirements are set for allowing the former than the latter.</p>
<h2>The defence industry, its market and military equipment exports</h2>
<p>Like many other product markets, the military equipment market is global, but this market is not governed solely by traditional market economy and technical factors. The military equipment market is instead governed by parameters and conditions other than those of purely a business economics nature. The political involvement of states means that the military equipment market differs substantially from other markets. The potential customers in the military equipment market principally consist of countries, and it is also countries that decide to whom the defence industry may export.</p>
<p>The Swedish defence industry has undergone dramatic and extensive structural change since the current military equipment legislation came into force on 1 January 1993. Reduced orders from the Swedish Armed Forces have meant that exports have become necessary and crucial in enabling the domestic defence industry to retain technical expertise and capacity. Most of what the defence industry manufactures today is exported to other countries. As a result of the extensive structural changes undergone by the defence industry, the industry has been internationalised in recent decades. Large parts of the Swedish defence industry today are owned by foreign companies or by shareholders in an international market. Those companies where the parent company has a registered office in Sweden in turn have subsidiaries in other countries.</p>
<p>The global military equipment market is dominated today by six countries (United States, Russia, France, United Kingdom, Germany and China). These countries account for around 80% of all military equipment exports. Swedish military equipment exports have been around 1% of total Swedish exports for a number of years. Swedish exports of military equipment totalled SEK 7.9 billion in 2014. This was a decrease in exports of around 33% compared with 2013, when exports totalled SEK 11.9 billion. It is apparent from the statistics that exports fluctuate over time. Exports in 2012 were SEK 9.7 billion, which was a decrease compared with 2011 when exports totalled SEK 13.9 billion, the highest level of exports recorded to date. It further follows from the military equipment export statistics that sales of major weapons systems have a great impact on export statistics. Sales of major weapons systems to countries other than Sweden’s traditional partner countries have increased in recent years, which has led to a certain shift in Swedish military equipment exports from western countries to other countries.</p>
<h2>A policy in flux – how the defence industry and military equipment exports are viewed</h2>
<p>The policy areas that govern export controls policy are security, defence and foreign policy. These are not static policy areas; rather, they change over time. The traditional elements in foreign policy behind the fundamental ban on military equipment exports, i.e. a desire to stay out of the armed conflicts of other countries, as well as work on arms control, are generally applicable. In addition, the overarching foreign policy objective to contribute to peace and security and promote human rights has had a great impact on the formulation of the export control rules. It follows from the guidelines that military equipment exports may lead to a conflict of aims and interests arising between foreign policy on the one hand and security and defence policy on the other.</p>
<p>Export controls policy is also affected by the changes that take place in security and defence policy. The changes that have taken place in these areas have affected the view taken of both the domestic defence policy and military equipment exports. In defence policy the changed supply of equipment has perhaps the greatest impact on the Swedish defence industry at present. Both the Government and the Riksdag now take a positive view of the defence industry developing and producing military equipment not intended solely for the Swedish Armed Forces. Developments in security policy in themselves have provided more reasons for granting military equipment export licences, not least as a consequence of globalisation and the broadened concept of security. This does not just cover the country’s own physical territory; security of flow has also become crucial to the broadened concept of security.</p>
<h2>The committee’s proposals for the design of future Swedish military equipment export controls</h2>
<p>The committee proposes a number of different measures, each of which makes military equipment export controls more stringent. Most of the proposals made by the committee do not only have a bearing on the assessment of applications for licences to export to countries that are non-democratic. The proposal that has a special bearing on non-democratic countries is the committee’s proposal to introduce a specific democracy criterion into the guidelines.</p>
<p>With regard to the regulatory framework for export controls, the committee proposes that the current structure be retained. This means that the Military Equipment Act should continue to indicate what the focus should be on in assessing applications for licences, while the general principles and criteria to be considered in assessing applications for licences are contained in separate guidelines. The guidelines are not to be given statutory status as the assessment of applications for licences is to be based on weighing up the pros and cons in a political sense and not establishing any positive rights that can be reviewed in a legal process.</p>
<p>The Military Equipment Act should continue to uphold a general ban on the manufacture, supply and export of military equipment and on the provision of technical assistance to anyone outside the country. It must be possible for licences to be granted under certain circumstances. Assessments of applications for licences under the Military Equipment Act should continue to be based on security, defence and foreign policy considerations. The ECC should maintain its role as an advisory body, as this creates the conditions necessary to obtain a broad parliamentary base regarding military equipment export controls. Political responsibility for the decisions made in accordance with military equipment legislation rests ultimately with the Government. This applies in particular to cases relating to vital national security interests. The rules on export controls must make it possible for the Government to fulfil its responsibility for national security.</p>
<h2>Proposal for a new Military Equipment Act</h2>
<p>The committee proposes that a new Military Equipment Act be enacted. The principal aim is to make the wording of the Act clearer, including by dividing it into chapters. As well as this purely editorial change, for purposes of clarification and information, the Act should explain the systematic nature of the export controls system more effectively than law currently in force, including by stating that the assessment of applications for licences is based on an overall assessment if there is no international obligation that prohibits a licence from being granted.</p>
<p>A factor that has an impact on the assessment of applications for licences is the international obligations to which Sweden is party. In certain cases, under international law, there is an obligation for Sweden to comply with international decisions. This is not apparent from the Military Equipment Act, and the committee regards this as a shortcoming. For purposes of clarification and information, some of the material changes proposed by the committee in relation to tightening export control rules should also be apparent from the wording of the Act, for instance the political responsibility of the Government being clarified, the circle of players required to obtain a licence being expanded to also include Swedish citizens abroad, and Swedish authorities needing a licence to manufacture and supply military equipment. There is a broad political desire on the committee for the Military Equipment Act, for the same purpose, to also provide general instructions on the intended focus of the assessment of applications for licences regarding exports and other cooperation with foreign partners. It should therefore be apparent from the wording of the Act that the assessment of applications for licences should focus on the democratic status of the recipient country, its respect for human freedoms and rights and the extent to which the country is engaged in armed conflict or is at risk of becoming involved in such conflict. Such clarification does not alter the structure of the export controls rules i.e. the Military Equipment Act specifies the direction that the licensing procedure should have, while the general principles and criteria to be taken into account when considering license applications are presented in separate guidelines. Thus, this clarification does not mean that the assessment of applications for licences switches to being application of a standard. The assessment of applications for licences continues to reflect a political assessment based on political considerations.</p>
<p>In addition, for the purpose of clarification the name of the act should be changed to Act on Control of Military Equipment and of Technical Assistance.</p>
<h2>Proposals for structure and formulation of new guidelines</h2>
<p>The current written guidelines do not fully reflect the principles and criteria that should underpin the assessment of applications for licences for the export of military equipment, provision of technical assistance to a party abroad or other cooperation with partner countries. The changes that have taken place in security, defence and foreign policy since the guidelines were drawn up must be reflected in them. The proposals made by the committee for tightening military equipment export controls should also be reflected in the guidelines.</p>
<p>The circumstances regarding security, defence and foreign policy for Sweden have changed since the guidelines were drawn up. For example, the need for international cooperation and collaboration in this area has increased. In addition, Sweden has become party to a number of international obligations and undertakings in the area of military equipment export controls, including the EU’s Common Position on Arms Exports and the</p>
<p>UN’s Arms Trade Treaty (ATT). Although the ISP now takes account of the criteria that follow from these international agreements in its assessment of applications for licences, the criteria have not been incorporated in the Swedish guidelines. This poses a risk of ambiguity as there are differences between the Swedish guidelines on the one hand and the EU’s Common Position on Arms Exports and the UN’s Arms Trade Treaty on the other. The applicable written Swedish guidelines are not always more restrictive than the criteria that follow from the international obligations. The joint position is more restrictive, for example, as it includes criteria that stipulate that an export licence must not be granted if certain circumstances indicated in the position are present, for example if there is a risk of the military equipment concerned being used for internal repression. This also highlights the principal difference between the international obligations and commitments and the Swedish guidelines. In the Swedish guidelines, as expressed in the conditional obstacles, an assessment must be made of the situation in the potential recipient country as such, primarily with regard to the presence or risk of armed conflict, as well as the human rights situation. Unlike the Swedish guidelines, which assess the recipient country as such, the criteria that follow from the international obligations are based on an equipment-specific approach having to be observed in the assessment of applications for licences.</p>
<p>The fact that the principles and criteria underpinning the assessment of applications for export licences are contained in several documents creates uncertainty and ambiguity regarding export controls policy. This becomes particularly clear in cases where there is no consistency between the principles and criteria contained in these various documents. In the committee’s view, the principles and criteria to be respected in the assessment of applications for licences should instead be collated in one document. As a result the guidelines can bring together all national and international principles and criteria that should underpin the assessment of applications for licences.</p>
<p>The committee’s remit does not include presenting new guidelines. On the other hand, the committee makes proposals on how new guidelines could be structured and formulated and how the assessment based on these should be made. The committee’s proposal in this context is that the assessment should be made in stages. The assessment of applications for licences should be based on whether a licence is compatible with the international obligations to which Sweden is party. In cases where a licence would contravene Sweden’s international obligations, an application for an export licence is to be refused for that reason alone. If there are no international obligations to refuse an application for a licence to export military equipment from Sweden, an overall assessment must be made which firstly takes account of the international criteria Sweden has undertaken to meet in assessing applications for licences, and secondly complies with the national criteria that Sweden has unilaterally decided to introduce into the assessment (the ‘conditional obstacles’).</p>
<h2>Fundamental principles of assessment of applications for licences</h2>
<p>If there is no international obligation entailing that a licence cannot be granted, an overall assessment must be made in the assessment of applications for licences. The overall assessment is a total appraisal of the security, defence and foreign policy grounds in favour of and militating against granting a licence under the Military Equipment Act. This procedure is due to the policy areas concerned being weighted differently in different situations. Making an overall assessment when examining an application for a licence ensures that account can be taken of all circumstances relevant to the case. This includes a country possibly being eligible as a recipient of certain military equipment from Sweden, while some types of military equipment should be exempted. A more restrictive attitude is to be adopted with regard to military equipment for combat purposes, i.e. equipment which in everyday language consists of weapons, than for other military equipment. In cases where an unconditional obstacle is present (i.e. if Sweden has undertaken not to grant licences based on an international obligation) the application assessment process is to be concluded without a licence being granted.</p>
<h2>International obligations</h2>
<p>In the current Swedish guidelines Sweden’s international obligations regarding military equipment export controls are regulated in the ‘unconditional obstacles’. Unconditional obstacles exist if exporting military equipment would contravene an international agreement to which Sweden is party, a decision of the UN Security Council or international law on exports from neutral countries during war. By adopting the EU’s Common Position on Arms Exports, Sweden undertook to comply with certain criteria in its assessment of applications for military equipment export licences. The obligations that follow from the UN’s Arms Trade Treaty have also subsequently been added.</p>
<p>The committee’s view is that, as far as possible, the international obligations should be reproduced verbatim in the guidelines. As the international agreements make use of different terms, it must be ensured in wording such guidelines that the terms used are those that are the most restrictive, thus ensuring that Sweden meets its international obligations.</p>
<h2>Proposal for the introduction of a democracy criterion</h2>
<p>The committee proposes that a democracy criterion be introduced into the guidelines. Under this criterion, the democratic status of the recipient country must be a key condition in the assessment of applications for licences. As a result of introducing a democracy criterion, the democratic status of a country is highlighted more clearly as an important foreign policy factor in the overall assessment made in each individual case. Granting a licence to export military equipment to a country that has severe shortcomings in terms of its democratic status can regarded as legitimising or giving political support to the regime in office. This in turn may counteract Sweden’s overarching foreign policy objective to promote democracy and human rights. A national democracy criterion based on the recipient country as such complements the current conditional obstacles in the applicable guidelines. The necessary basis is consequently created for an overall assessment of the objectives that have been especially highlighted in foreign policy. It can generally be said that the greater the democratic deficit, the more foreign policy reasons there are for not granting a licence.</p>
<p>The committee’s proposal for the introduction of a democracy criterion is based on the fact that an assessment of whether a country can be regarded as a democracy or not must take account of both the presence of democratic institutions (formal democracy) and how well these institutions work in practice (real democracy). For it to be possible for a country to be regarded as a democracy, it is required to fulfil certain fundamental requirements and have certain democratic institutions in place. The democratic institutions set the frameworks for how popular participation in elections to the country’s political assemblies is guaranteed. Democracy requires that popularly elected representatives can be held to account and that there is a distribution of power between certain institutions of democracy. The existence of political parties, independent media and active non-governmental organisations which are allowed to operate freely is also a basic requirement. In addition it is a requirement that all citizens have knowledge of their rights and an opportunity to avail themselves of these rights.</p>
<p>The democratic deficit in those countries that are to be regarded as non-democratic can differ markedly. The democratic status of a country should be assessed so that account can be taken of the range that may exist between different countries – everything from consolidated democracies to countries with extensive shortcomings in terms of their democratic status. No predetermined dividing line between countries to be regarded as democratic and nondemocratic can be established. It is thus not possible to decide in advance which countries can be categorised as one or the other. The democratic status of a country must therefore be assessed on a case-by-case basis. The committee proposes that the democratic status of a country can be suitably assessed on the basis of the following fundamental criteria.  Occurrence of open and fair elections, with universal and equal suffrage.  That these elections are ‘effective’ in the sense that they relate to the senior positions in the country, and that these in turn have control over the territory of the country.  That a number of political freedoms and rights are also maintained between elections, in particular freedom of opinion (which includes freedom of expression and freedom of the press), freedom of organisation and assembly, and associated freedom from oppression and repression.</p>
<p>Further guidance on how an assessment should be made is to be based on the elements which the UN General Assembly has established as essential to a democracy. These include:  Respect for human rights and the fundamental freedoms, including freedom of religion, association, assembly, expression and opinion.  The right of the citizens to take part in attending to general matters, directly or through freely elected representatives, and the right to be elected in periodically held free and general elections.  The presence of universal and equal suffrage (voting should be secret to guarantee that the will of the people is freely expressed).  That the political system is a pluralistic system with political parties and organisations.  Respect for the principle of the rule of law, including distribution of power between executive, judicial and legislative institutions, and the independence of the justice system.  That public administration is open and accountable.  Existence of free, independent and pluralistic media.</p>
<h2>Proposals for amendment of the conditional obstacle in relation to human rights</h2>
<p>The currently applicable obstacle relating to human rights means that a licence should not be granted for a country in which gross and widespread violations of human rights occur. The concept of gross and widespread violations of human rights thus constitutes a ‘threshold’ for when this conditional obstacle is to be regarded as being present. It follows from the practice that has emerged regarding the interpretation of gross and widespread violations that it has principally concerned violations of people’s physical safety. The interpretation of what constitutes gross violations of human rights includes genocide, extrajudicial and summary execution, enforced disappearance, slavery and slave trading, extrajudicial and summary enforced detention over a long period, torture, crimes against humanity and apartheid. The ISP emphasises in its account of how practice has developed that this list is not exhaustive. Other violations of human rights may thus also be regarded as gross. Furthermore, the ISP states that the interpretation of the term ‘widespread’ is that it should be a matter of systematic violations of human rights. As a result of the development in practice that has taken place, the concept of gross and widespread violations of human rights has primarily come to refer to people’s physical safety. The committee considers that gross and widespread violations of human rights can take place in relation to all human rights – civic, political, economic, social and cultural. A single violation of human rights is not, however, sufficient for the national criterion to be regarded as met. For the obstacle to exist, the violations must be of a particular scope and/or systematic and take place at the behest of the country concerned or through its condoning of or failure to prosecute crime.</p>
<p>To summarise, the committee’s view is that the conditional obstacle in relation to human rights has been interpreted too narrowly. The threshold at which it is to be applicable should therefore be lowered. The committee considers that the term ‘serious’ should be used instead of ‘gross’, firstly to highlight this change and secondly because the international obligations to which Sweden has become party in the area use the term ‘serious’.</p>
<p>The committee considers that the regulations should continue to uphold the principle that compliance of a potential recipient country with human rights in a broad sense is to be taken into account. Not solely basing the assessment of human rights on an equipment-specific approach involves a substantially more restrictive attitude in assessing applications for licences than follows from international obligations. The equipment-specific approach contained in the international obligations and commitments should therefore continue to be supplemented in the new guidelines by a national obstacle regarding the human rights situation in the recipient country. It is to follow from such an obstacle that a country’s respect for human rights shall be a key condition in the assessment of applications for licences and means that the overall human rights situation in a potential recipient country must be assessed. Licences should not be granted to a country in which serious violations of human rights occur and which in some sense are systematic. Because the assessment of applications for licences must be made on a case-by-case basis and be based on an overall assessment, all the circumstances in the individual case are to be taken into account in assessing whether widespread and serious violations of human rights are considered to occur in a particular country.</p>
<p>Proposals for the design of obstacles relating to human rights and democratic status</p>
<p>In view of the strong correlation that exists between a country’s respect for human rights and its democratic status, the committee proposes that these should be treated jointly in the guidelines. The committee proposes that the following wording be introduced into the guidelines:</p>
<p>Respect for human rights and the democratic status of the recipient country are key conditions in assessing applications for licences. A country’s democratic status is assessed on the basis of the existence of democratic institutions, the country’s respect for democratic processes and civic and political rights. The worse the democratic status, the less scope there is for licences to be granted. If serious and widespread violations of human rights or grave shortcomings in democratic status occur, they constitute obstacles to the granting of licences.</p>
<h2>Proposal to retain the conditional obstacle in relation to armed conflicts</h2>
<p>The foreign policy obstacle that military equipment should not be exported to a country involved in armed conflict with another country, a country embroiled an international conflict that is in danger of turning into armed conflict or a country where there is internal armed unrest, remains applicable. There is equivalence to this conditional obstacle in both the UN Arms Trade Treaty and the EU’s Common Position on Arms Exports. The fact that this circumstance exists in both the Swedish regulations and in international rules means that there is some overlap between the guidelines and international obligations. However, the point of departure for assessment differs in the different sets of rules. The national assessment of applications for licences considers the recipient country as a whole, while the international obligations are based on what kind of military equipment is to be exported. In view of this, the sets of rules complement one another. The committee therefore considers that the conditional obstacle relating to armed conflicts should be retained as a national obstacle.</p>
<h2>Proposal for the Policy for Global Development to be taken into account in the assessment of applications for licences</h2>
<p>The committee considers that the assessment of applications for licences should contain a requirement that an analysis be made of how a military equipment export for which a licence is granted may affect the objectives of the Policy for Global Development (PGD) adopted by the Riksdag. This should take place, in the committee’s view, by it being made clear in the guidelines that the PGD is to be taken into account in assessing applications for licences. In reaching decisions an assessment must be made of what impact the export of military equipment is expected to have on the fulfilment of PGD objectives.</p>
<p>The committee proposes that the guidelines be supplemented as follows:</p>
<p>In assessing applications for licences to export military equipment, provide technical assistance to anyone abroad or other cooperation with foreign partners on military equipment, particular account is to be taken of consistency with the Policy for Global Development (PGD). An analysis is to be made in applicable cases from which it is apparent whether the intended export of military equipment may counteract efforts to meet objectives set in the PGD.</p>
<h2>Proposals concerning follow-on deliveries</h2>
<p>To enable the domestic defence industry to operate in the export market, the requirements of the purchasing country for security of supply must be taken into account in the export controls regulations. It is therefore particularly important to regulate clearly in the rules on export controls how the issue of security of supply is to be addressed.</p>
<p>The current guidelines state that follow-on delivery means spare parts for previously exported military equipment, ammunition related to previously exported military equipment or exports where it would otherwise be unreasonable not to grant a licence. The concept of follow-on delivery does not appear in the guidelines, but does appear in the text on motivation in the guidelines, without any exhaustive definition being given. What is to be regarded as follow-on delivery has instead been clarified by development of practice. The follow-on delivery situations have been divided into different types, which in turn can be divided into three sub-groups: spare parts for previously supplied military equipment, specific ammunition for previously supplied military equipment and deliveries directly related to previously granted export licences where it would be unreasonable not to grant licences. In the assessment of the latter type of follow-on delivery, an assessment of unreasonableness ought to recur more frequently than in the other types of follow-on delivery included in this sub-group.</p>
<p>The committee proposes that the interpretation of what constitutes a follow-on delivery be made narrower than currently follows from the guidelines and from the development of practice that has taken place. In the committee’s view, the follow-on delivery types of replacement delivery, supplementary delivery, recurring acquisition and related equipment should not automatically be regarded as a follow-on delivery. In those cases where there is a clear direct correlation between previously granted export licences and current export, such export is to be regarded as a follow-on delivery. This is the case, for example, with regard to upgrading previously delivered weapons systems or maintenance equipment for such systems. For a direct correlation to be considered to exist, however, there must be a direct link to the products previously exported. A follow-on delivery case, like any other export case, must be assessed on the basis of applicable sets of rules. However, it follows from the guidelines that there is a presumption of assent with regard to follow-on deliveries, provided that there are no unconditional obstacles.</p>
<p>The presumption of licences being granted for follow-on deliveries is to remain, but an assessment must always be made in the individual case to ensure that licences do not conflict with Sweden’s international obligations or if the recipient country has not fulfilled its undertakings to Sweden which may, for example, follow from an end-user certificate. The presumption should be breached in such situations. Furthermore, in assessing applications for licences, account is also to be taken of whether the situation in the recipient country has substantially worsened in comparison with the situation that prevailed when the original decision was made. The ECC should be consulted in such cases. In addition, the ECC should be consulted in cases where a reasonability assessment must be made in relation to whether a particular export is to be regarded as a follow-on delivery. The committee proposes that the following rule on follow-on delivery be introduced into the guidelines:</p>
<p>Licences should be granted for follow-on deliveries. Follow-on delivery means the export of spare parts, ammunition and other deliveries, for example maintenance equipment and upgrades, which are directly related to previously delivered military equipment.</p>
<h2>Remit to survey the export controls systems of other partner countries</h2>
<p>The committee notes that none of the countries studied has a ‘democracy criterion’ in its regulations. The committee further notes that the Swedish rules on export controls differ in several respects from the rules in the countries studied. Sweden is alone in having transferred the assessment of applications for licences as a general rule to an administrative authority, instead of assessment being handled directly by the Government. A further difference is that the underlying principle in Sweden is that exports of military equipment in general are prohibited, but that exemptions from this ban can be granted if there are defence or security policy reasons for doing so. Some countries have a similar basic premise. For the majority of countries in the comparison, however, the basic premise is that the export of military equipment is in principle permitted, but that export licences will not be granted under certain circumstances. This difference is likely to be explained by the countries studied prohibiting exports ultimately to prevent valuable technology and/or knowledge ending up in the hands of the wrong user, and applications for licences being assessed on the basis of an equipment-specific assessment that includes both enduser and end-use, instead of reviewing the recipient country as such.</p>
<h2>Remit to increase openness and transparency in Swedish export controls</h2>
<p>The committee proposes several measures, each of which increases openness and transparency in the export control of military equipment. It is proposed that, in relation to the general public, greater clarity be provided on the reasons for the decisions, the Government take political responsibility more clearly than at present for decisions made and that official reporting on export controls be enhanced. The possibility of political accountability for decisions made is improved by increased openness and transparency. Improvements regarding reporting should also be made in relation to the Riksdag, regarding both unclassified and classified information. The ‘prior notices’ (the committee’s proposal is that, in future, these should be termed preliminary assessments) should be reported to the Riksdag, thus ensuring greater transparency on the decisions made by the Government and the ISP, including the weighing-up that has taken place in each individual case and the fact that the Riksdag is informed about the recommendation made by the ECC. This must take place in consideration of the fact these cases are often covered by secrecy, principally defence, foreign-policy and commercial secrecy. It is proposed that, in addition to ordinary members of the ECC, deputy members should also be appointed. The committee further proposes that a system of post-controls be introduced to ensure that the products and the know-how supplied reach the intended end-user.</p>
<p>In addition it is proposed that the Government, in its annual written communication to the Riksdag, should provide more detailed information about the applications for export licences granted and refused, as well as more information concerning what actual exports have taken place. With regard to granted export licences, the written communications should indicate the licences granted broken down into the various categories in the EU military list, together with a brief description of the transferred or exported military equipment. Information should also be provided on the identity of the end-user. This should be based on four categories: military, police, other government authority and industry. The data on actual exports should indicate the quantity or number of products exported and a description of the military equipment. In cases where the number cannot be stated, for example due to commercial or foreign-policy secrecy, this should be indicated.</p>
<p>It is further proposed that a separate account be given through case studies. These should cover decisions to grant military equipment export licences in cases where there is an obvious conflict of interest between security and defence policy on the one hand and foreign policy on the other. The account given should, as far as possible, describe how the different policy areas have been weighed against each other and clarify why one particular area of policy weighed more heavily than another.</p>
<p>It is proposed that the monthly reports presented by the ISP on granted export licences be made more detailed. This can be achieved by these reports also detailing sales of military equipment broken down by recipient country and product based on the category areas in the list of military equipment. It is further proposed that a more in-depth account be given of exports of small arms and light weapons. Hunting and sports weapons should also be reported separately in the account given.</p>
<p>Finally it is proposed that post-controls be carried out continuously. However, to enable this, end-user certificates must be worded in such way as to make this possible. The end-user certificates must consequently be revised to ensure that the recipient country approves post-controls being carried out. The focus in post-controls should be firstly on military equipment where there is a great risk of diversion to an unintended recipient and secondly on military equipment where there is interest on the part of Sweden in ensuring that the technology and/or technical know-how that is exported is not disseminated. Procedures for the organisation of post-controls should be devised by the ISP as the licensing authority, following collaboration with affected authorities and with the defence industry.</p>
<p>The committee considers that decisions following from the Military Equipment Act should as far as possible be presented to the public, particularly with regard to military equipment export licences granted. With regard to granted and published decisions, the committee does not see any obstacle to a member of the ECC describing their recommendation, including the factors weighed up in an individual case.</p>
<h2>Consequences if export controls for non-democratic countries are tightened</h2>
<p>The issue of granting export licences for military equipment involves substantially more considerations than merely the question of the export as such. The issue of military equipment exports is ultimately concerned with Sweden’s defence, security and foreign policy. Granting an export licence in an individual case has consequences for all these policy areas to a greater or lesser extent.</p>
<p>The intention behind the proposed tightening of the rules is to make exports of military equipment to non-democratic states more difficult. This will have consequences for Swedish military equipment exports.</p>
<p>Predicting how tightened rules for exports of military equipment to non-democratic countries will affect actual exports is, however, difficult in view of the factors of uncertainty that exist. It is not possible to make a quantitative analysis of this expected decrease in a meaningful manner. In view of this situation, a general account is given of how reduced military equipment exports may affect the domestic defence industry and how this in turn may affect the supply of military equipment to the Swedish Armed Forces, Sweden’s prospects of entering into international cooperation on military equipment, Sweden’s prospects of taking part in international peace and security missions, and the financial consequences for the defence industry and for the economy at large.</p>
<p>A direct consequence of reduced exports is that company revenues decline. It can generally be said that this leads to a deterioration in the competitiveness of companies and therefore in their prospects of retaining both capacity and expertise to operate at the forefront of technology. More restrictive export control rules will adversely affect the competitiveness of Swedish companies in comparison with companies from other countries.</p>
<p>The Swedish Armed Forces have a large number of military equipment systems in operation that have been manufactured by the Swedish defence industry, which means that there is a relationship of dependence on the domestic defence industry to maintain these equipment systems. Exporting these systems creates opportunities for cost-sharing with the purchasing country/countries for operation, upgrades and development of the systems. Reduced exports are likely to lead to a rise in the costs of military equipment supply to the Swedish Armed Forces.</p>
<p>By being able to retain some expertise, defence-industry capability and capacity, Swedish scope for action is also created in order to have access in the future to certain technology and industrial capacity if a need for particular technological expertise were to arise on the basis of benefit to defence. It may be noted that it has been possible to retain a certain level of expertise in Sweden thanks to individual export deals, and there is a risk of this being made more difficult by the committee’s proposals for tightening export controls on non-democratic countries.</p>
<p>The shift that has taken place in the boundaries between defence agencies and the defence industry in terms of technical expertise has indirectly led to a greater need for the defence industry to retain technical expertise in particular in Sweden. Cuts in government R&D budgets combined with increased investments by the defence industry in R&D have also led to increased dependence on the defence industry to maintain expertise within the country. Reduced export revenues will mean that defence industry companies will have fewer resources to earmark for R&D.</p>
<p>Having rules on export controls that are more restrictive than in potential partner countries is generally likely to mean that Sweden becomes a less attractive partner. This is particularly the case because a potential partner does not wish to risk the restrictions Sweden imposes on third-country exports. The difference in restrictiveness between the regulatory systems of different countries already exists today, at the same time as Swedish industry has extensive international cooperation. The fact that no other country at present has a democracy criterion in its export control rules will be a factor weighed into the equation by the partner if cooperation is to be initiated, and in this context is likely to be a complicating factor in bringing about such cooperation.</p>
<h2>Impact assessment</h2>
<p>The changes proposed in military equipment export controls, including the proposal to tighten the control of exports to non- democratic countries, will necessitate allocating resources to the ISP. New administrative resources will be required to deal with proposals for example on increased reporting, more detailed requirements for the basis on which decisions are made, the introduction of a democracy criterion and greater post-control. As well as increased resources through increased staffing levels, greater resources are required to manage changes for example in case management systems and for increased travel expenses. It is estimated that a sum of SEK 4–5 million annually is required to cover the cost of 4–5 full-time equivalent staff and other expenses.</p>
<p>The defence industry is a dominant feature of some municipalities. However, it is difficult to describe what the actual consequences of the committee’s proposals will be and therefore also how the proposals will affect these municipalities. Some municipalities have submitted statements on the significance of the defence industry for their particular regions. These make clear the importance of a major export company being located in the region and operating on the international market as such companies contribute towards smaller companies being able to break into the export market. If reduced military equipment exports lead to the development departments of defence industry companies disappearing or moving, this would also affect the development of the region. Such a scenario would change the whole structure of the business sector and have an adverse impact on economic development in the region.</p>
