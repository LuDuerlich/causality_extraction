<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Remit</h2>
<p>Our remit was to conduct a review of the lay judge system and to consider measures to create a modern lay judge system that can continue to maintain public confidence in the courts in the future. Within the context of this review, we were tasked more specifically with  making the  participation  of lay judges in court proceedings more effective,  reforming the  system of recruitment  of lay judges,  considering the need to change the rules concerning the  dismissal and suspension  of lay judges,  creating modern  terms of service and compensation for lay judge assignments, and  improving the  information and basic training provided to lay judges, as well as the ongoing exchange of information and other contacts between the courts and lay judges.</p>
<h2>The Inquiry’s starting points</h2>
<p>In the Inquiry’s view, lay judges have an important function in our courts. By monitoring the operations of the courts and having an influence over decisions, lay judges help to maintain public confidence in the judicial system and lend court decisions legitimacy. Therefore, the starting point for our inquiry work was that lay judges make a valuable contribution to our courts and that the importance of such an assignment should be made clear. However, we have observed that the participation of lay judges could be made more effective and that this would free up resources that could improve the terms of service for lay judges. We have also identified measures that should be taken to strengthen public confidence in the lay judge system. One of the important points is that the body of lay judges should be more representative of the Swedish population in terms of age than is currently the case. Another starting point for our proposals is the fact that lay judges are laypersons. From a public confidence perspective, it is also important to make it clear that the assignment is non-political.</p>
<h2>Effective participation by lay judges in court proceedings</h2>
<p>General</p>
<p>In our view, the need for transparency in our courts can be met through the overall control of the courts’ operations in general; this need is met even if lay judges do not participate in every single court case. Lay judges should contribute to the cases and court instances in which they, other than monitoring operations, can be of most use from other perspectives, e.g. by contributing their additional experience and view of the issues being examined in the case. The Inquiry considers that lay judges should not participate in cases of a straightforward nature. Nor is the participation of lay judges normally justified in cases mainly involving complicated legal issues. Lay judge participation should be concentrated on cases involving more extensive investigation or more complex assessments of reasonability or evidence.</p>
<p>Our proposals would lead to a reduction in lay judge participation in court proceedings. More concentrated participation – whereby lay judges take part in cases where they are most useful and are involved in a constructive way in the discussions during the court’s deliberations – would in our view create engagement on the part of the lay judges, which would in turn help to increase the importance and attractiveness of the assignment. Reduced lay judge participation in simple cases would also result in more efficient processing and can be expected to shorten processing times. On the basis of these starting points, we have submitted the following proposals on lay judge participation.</p>
<p>Number of lay judges and lay judges’ right to vote</p>
<p>For cases and matters before district and administrative courts in which lay judges participate, we propose that the court have a quorum of one legally qualified judge, and two lay judges, instead of three. If one of the lay judges is unable to attend once the main hearing has begun, the court is to have a quorum of one legally qualified judge and one lay judge. If the court has a reinforced composition and two of the lay judges are unable to attend, the members of the court should not constitute a quorum if the lay judges are in the minority. We consider that the conditions for a good dialogue in court would improve with such a reduction, and there would then also be an odd number of members, which is an advantage when it comes to voting. We do not propose any changes concerning lay judges’ individual right to vote; on the contrary, we consider it is an important way to stress the importance of the assignment and ensure that lay judges feel and take responsibility for decisions.</p>
<p>Lay judge participation in district court proceedings</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that for main hearings in criminal cases, a district court should have a quorum of one legally qualified judge if the offences being considered in the case do not carry a heavier penalty than two years’ imprisonment. The same should apply when a district court rules on a matter referred to in Chapter 38, Section 6 of the Swedish Penal Code (revocation of a sanction, etc.) and to cases concerning the conversion of fines. The Inquiry also proposes removing the requirement that a lay judge always participate in the decision when a court clerk or drafting lawyer qualified to serve in the district court processes criminal cases in the district court.</p>
<p>The Inquiry does not propose any changes concerning the participation of lay judges in family cases.</p>
<p>We propose removing the requirement that lay judges always participate when the district court rules on matters concerning enforcement under the Children and Parents Code, non-contact orders, access bans and trading prohibitions. Instead, the same quorum rules should apply as apply to other matters, i.e. that lay judges should be able to participate if there are special grounds for this considering the nature of the matter.</p>
<p>Lay judge participation in administrative court proceedings</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes new quorum rules for administrative courts. In contrast to the regulations currently applicable, we propose that the court should, as a rule, comprise one legally qualified judge. Lay judges should participate in proceedings when an administrative court makes a final ruling on the substance of a case if any of the parties is a natural person and the case involves comprehensive assessments of reasonability or evidence that do not refer to the levying of taxes, fees or duties, or if the case concerns deprivation of liberty or committing a person for care. Lay judges may also participate in other cases if there are grounds for this considering the nature of the case. Apart from the fact that lay judges will no longer participate in tax cases, the proposed quorum rule does not entail any major changes in practice concerning lay judge participation in administrative court proceedings.</p>
<p>We also propose that it should be made easier to reinforce the court with additional members by removing the requirement for special grounds. In future, it should suffice that there are grounds for doing so, considering the scale or complexity of the case. It must be possible for administrative courts to reinforce their composition, including in cases in which lay judges are not participating; this means that administrative courts may in future have a quorum of two legally qualified judges and no lay judge. The option of reinforcing the court’s composition in cases with lay judge participation should remain in place.</p>
<p>Finally, the Inquiry proposes removing the requirement that a lay judge always participate in the decision when a court clerk or drafting lawyer qualified to serve in the district court processes cases in the administrative court.</p>
<p>Lay judge participation in court of appeal and administrative court of appeal proceedings</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that lay judges should not participate in court of appeal and administrative court of appeal proceedings. The main focus of the legal process lies in the first instance. The role of the court of appeal and the administrative court of appeal is to review decisions made by the lower courts, and they usually base their decisions on the same material as the lower courts. In our view, lay judge participation when the court of appeal and the administrative court of appeal settle cases has limited added value; the need for transparency has already been sufficiently well met through lay judge participation in the lower court proceedings. The possibilities of referring to evidence already presented in the lower courts are also made easier when lay judges do not participate.</p>
<h2>Suitable lay judges</h2>
<p>Public confidence in, and the legitimacy of, participation by laypersons in the adjudication process depend on the people chosen as lay judges themselves inspiring confidence and being suitable for the assignment. Under the current rules, only persons who are suitable for the assignment in terms of judgment, independence, abidance by the law and other circumstances may be appointed lay judges (Chapter 4, Section 6 of the Code of Judicial Procedure and Section 20 of the Administrative Courts Act (1971:289)). The Inquiry proposes amending the provision so that only persons who are suitable may be appointed lay judges. The proposal entails a clarification of the requirement that municipalities and county councils conduct a careful examination of each individual candidate’s suitability.</p>
<p>Bankruptcy is currently a circumstance that is considered within the context of the suitability assessment. This differs from the eligibility requirements for permanent judges. The Inquiry proposes introducing an eligibility requirement stating that lay judges may not be bankrupt.</p>
<h2>Recruitment and election of lay judges</h2>
<p>The Inquiry has considered a number of different methods for appointing lay judges. Common to all of these alternative systems is that they entail centralisation or regionalisation of the recruitment procedure. The Inquiry has concluded that lay judges should continue to be appointed through election by municipal and county council assemblies. These locally elected assemblies have a sound democratic base and function in the same manner throughout the country. Citizens and other permanent residents have an influence on the composition of these elected assemblies; therefore, this is a way of ensuring that lay judges are the public’s representatives in the courts.</p>
<p>It is currently the political parties represented in the assemblies that nominate lay judges to the municipal and county council assemblies, and the political parties are also responsible in practice for recruiting all lay judges. It is the Inquiry’s view that the parties take this task very seriously, and that they also put due effort into the nomination process. However, despite various initiatives, such as information campaigns, young people are still underrepresented among lay judges. This is a problem as it risks undermining public confidence in the lay judge system. The investigation carried out by the Inquiry has shown that the parties have done very little to change their working methods on this matter and that recruitment still largely occurs within party circles. Less than four per cent of the Swedish electorate are members of a political party. The Inquiry has concluded that the recruitment process needs to be broadened to circles other than the political parties if the body of lay judges is to be rejuvenated. Such a system would also make clear the nonpolitical nature of the lay judge assignment.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes a reform of the recruitment process. Anyone who is interested in becoming a lay judge should be able to apply for the assignment to the municipality or county council where he or she is registered as a resident. Applications should be made on a form designed for this purpose. It should also be possible for anyone to nominate another person for the assignment. The nominee for the lay judge assignment should confirm the nomination by signing a form designed for this purpose.</p>
<p>We consider that merely opening up the applications procedure is not enough to broaden the recruitment base and rejuvenate the body of lay judges. The Inquiry proposes the introduction of a requirement, established in law, that an assembly must elect at least half of the lay judges from those candidates who have not been nominated by a political party that is represented in the assembly (a ‘free quota’). The free quota is to be elected through a majority vote. For voting in general, the option of requesting proportional voting should remain.</p>
<p>As is currently the case, municipalities and county councils must check the eligibility of candidates and assess the candidates’ suitability for the lay judge assignment before electing lay judges. This applies to the candidates nominated by political parties and to those applying through the free quota. Municipalities and county councils are free to determine how the lay judge election is to be prepared, but the Inquiry considers it appropriate that this work be carried out by officials.</p>
<p>In future, the courts must also check that those elected as lay judges are eligible for the assignment. We propose that the courts should also check whether the newly elected lay judges have a criminal record.</p>
<p>To further clarify that the assignment is non-political, the Inquiry proposes that the election of lay judges be carried out on a separate occasion to the general elections. We propose a transitional provision stating that the term of office for the lay judges elected in the next election (autumn 2014) be limited to one year only. New lay judge elections will thus be held in the autumn of 2015. In future, this will mean that lay judges are elected in the autumn of the year following the general elections.</p>
<p>We do not propose any upper age limit to be eligible for election as a lay judge, nor do we propose any limit to the number of terms a lay judge may serve.</p>
<h2>Dismissal and suspension</h2>
<p>One aspect that is important from a public confidence perspective is that only people who are suitable for the assignment should serve as lay judges in our courts. Under the current rules, a lay judge is to be dismissed if he or she has proved to be clearly  unsuitable for the assignment (Chapter 4, Section 8, third paragraph of the Swedish Code of Judicial Procedure and Section 21, second paragraph of the Administrative Courts Act (1971:289)). The Inquiry proposes that it should be possible to dismiss a lay judge if he or she has proved to be merely unsuitable for the assignment. The requirement that a lay judge is clearly  unsuitable for the assignment will thus be replaced by the requirement that he or she is unsuitable. This means that the courts are given greater scope to dismiss a lay judge who proves to be unsuitable to continue the assignment.</p>
<p>The Inquiry does not propose any changes to the rules on suspending lay judges.</p>
<h2>Terms of service and compensation</h2>
<p>Remuneration is perceived to be, and is, an important marker for the importance and status in society of the lay judge assignment. At the same time, the level of compensation should reflect the fact that the lay judge assignment is a lay assignment. In light of this, the Inquiry proposes that the daily remuneration be doubled. Our proposal means that the remuneration model would provide payment for half a day (SEK 500) for service for a maximum of four hours including breaks, and payment for a whole day (SEK 1 000) for service in excess of four hours. The Inquiry also proposes that extra compensation (SEK 250) should be paid for service after 16.30. In addition, the Inquiry proposes that background reading remuneration should be paid for preparatory work in excess of one hour, the same level for district and administrative courts. There are no proposed changes to the rules on compensation for a cancelled hearing and compensation for loss of income from work.</p>
<p>In order to achieve a more balanced composition of the body of lay judges, it is important that the frequency with which lay judges are required to serve is steady and predictable. We propose introducing a target rule, whereby every lay judge should serve a minimum of eight days and no more than twenty-five days in one year.</p>
<h2>Information and training for lay judges</h2>
<p>Comprehensive training for lay judges is not reconcilable with their role as laypersons. However, it is important that lay judges have a good understanding of what their role in the court entails and have knowledge of the issues that are important for their assignment. While the large majority of courts organise induction courses for new lay judges, far from all newly elected lay judges take part in this training. The Inquiry proposes that attendance of an induction course be a prerequisite for a new lay judge being permitted to start serving in court. It may be necessary to revisit the issues and subjects covered in the induction course after a period of time. We therefore consider that re-elected lay judges who have previously taken part in an induction course should attend a repeat course organised by the court. This should be done within six months of the re-elected lay judge beginning service and should be a prerequisite for continued service.</p>
<p>It is already the case that the courts have an obligation to continuously provide lay judges with information on issues that are important for their assignment. We consider that the courts should become better at holding a dialogue with the lay judges concerning scheduling, for example. A good dialogue creates a better working atmosphere for all involved and ultimately benefits public confidence in the courts.</p>
<p>The qualified judge has an important role as regards cooperation with lay judges. We consider that judicial training programmes should include elements that focus on this and on how to achieve good deliberations.</p>
<h2>Consequences of the proposals</h2>
<p>Our overarching objective was to submit proposals for measures that ensure that we will continue to have a lay judge system that can help to maintain public confidence in the courts, and that we have the appropriate level of participation by lay judges.</p>
<p>The changes will affect the people who may be elected lay judges, as well as the courts, municipalities and county councils.</p>
<p>The proposal that lay judges no longer participate in court of appeal and administrative court of appeal proceedings will result in reduced costs. The proposal to reduce the number of lay judges from three to two and to limit lay judge participation in various types of cases will also mean a reduction in costs. The proposals concerning improved financial terms for lay judges will mean a rise in costs, but this will be covered by the reduction in costs brought about by the other proposals. With the abovementioned reduction in costs, resources will be available to finance the increase in costs that will arise for municipalities and county councils as a result of reforming the recruitment system. Further, there will be scope for appropriations to the National Courts Administration for information initiatives.</p>
<p>As regards the consequences of the proposals for the size of the lay judge body, our proposals will lead to a reduction in the number of lay judges from approximately 8 300 to 5 200.</p>
<p>The changes we propose to the recruitment system will entail a certain amount of interference in the municipalities’ and county councils’ right to decide how they organise their work on lay judge elections. In our view, this limited interference in municipal selfdetermination is justified by the overarching interest in ensuring the balanced composition of the lay judge body and clarification that the lay judge assignment is non-political.</p>
<h2>Entry into force and implementation</h2>
<p>The proposed date of entry into force of these legislative amendments is 1 January 2015. Under our proposal, the new provisions concerning the election and recruitment of lay judges should be first implemented for the lay judges elected during the autumn of 2015 for the period starting 1 January 2016.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s proposals will mean relatively extensive changes to the lay judge system. We propose that the National Courts Administration be instructed by the Government to use the proposed ordinance concerning the procedure for lay judge applications and nominations as a guide in designing a form for this purpose, and carrying out an information campaign about the new recruitment procedure targeted at the general public and election assemblies.</p>
