<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>The remit</h2>
<p>The inquiry’s terms of reference of 18 November 2004 (ToR 2004:159) and supplementary terms of reference of 6 April 2006 assign responsibility for several tasks. The first is to propose the constitutional amendments deemed necessary for implementing in Swedish legislation European Parliament and Council Directive 2004/35/EC, subsequently referred to as the Environmental Liability Directive.</p>
<p>The second task is to examine whether a provision on “piercing the corporate veil” should be introduced into the field of environmental law.</p>
<p>The third is to present proposals on how Article 14 on financial guarantees of the European Parliament and Council Directive 2006/21/EC (Directive on the Management of Waste from the Extractive Industries), subsequently referred to as the Mining Waste Directive, could be implemented in Swedish legislation. In this connection, the requirements that should be stipulated and forms that may be acceptable are to be examined with regard to the guarantees that can be required under Chapter 9, Section 6 a, Chapter 15, Section 34 and Chapter 16, Section 3 of the Swedish Environmental Code.</p>
<p>A review is also to be made of the regulations on environmental damage insurance and environmental clean-up insurance in Chapter 33 of the Swedish Environmental Code.</p>
<p>Finally the inquiry’s supplementary terms of reference instruct it to examine the remedial action and damages that may be required in the event of damage to biological diversity caused by genetically modified organisms (GMOs).</p>
<h2>The report</h2>
<p>This interim report discusses all the above questions except those relating to environmental damage insurance, environmental clean-up insurance and GMO issues. We will return to these in the final report in November.</p>
<p>We are now presenting proposals for necessary amendments to the Swedish Environmental Code to pave the way for implementing the Environmental Liability Directive. In this section we also propose certain amendments to the Ordinance on Supervision under the Environmental Code (1998:900) and a completely new ordinance on determining remedial action in the event of serious environmental damage. A further proposal is a partially amended regulation with regard to guarantees in the Swedish Environmental Code and the Mining Waste Directive. We also present a possible regulation on “piercing the corporate veil”.</p>
<h2>The Environmental Liability Directive</h2>
<p>The European Parliament and Council adopted the Environmental Liability Directive on 21 April 2004. This was with the explicit intention to improve the application of environmental principles in the EC Treaty, primarily the polluter-pays principle, and to create Community law guarantees to ensure that damaged environments are rehabilitated. The Directive was approved with the support of Article 175 of the EC Treaty. This means that it is a minimum directive that allows Member States to retain or introduce stricter regulations on preventing and remedying environmental damage. The Directive is to be incorporated into national legislation by 30 April 2007. Six years later, the Member States are to report to the Commission on their experiences of applying the Directive. Based on this, the Commission is to present to the European Parliament a report containing appropriate draft amendments no later than 30 April 2014. Exemptions from liabilities under the Directive, GMOs and the extent of biological diversity protection are among the issues to be reviewed.</p>
<p>The implementation of the Directive in Swedish law primarily means more extensive environmental liability vis-à-vis the general public to prevent and remedy serious environmental damage and imminent threats of such damage. In effect almost all damage and risks of damage already trigger a certain degree of liability for those causing them, under the provisions of the Swedish Environmental Code. However this liability is now being tightened up and, equally important, clarified in the Directive’s regulations. This applies particularly to the issue of serious damage to water and to the biological diversity of protected species and protected natural habitats. It is primarily with respect to the latter that environmental interests are moving their positions forward. The protection of biological diversity means that nature as such gains its own, autonomous conservation value.</p>
<p>This environmental liability is exclusively a liability vis-à-vis the public. It does not cover any obligation to pay damages on grounds of civil law.</p>
<p>The circle of those responsible under the Swedish Environmental Code is extended under the Directive to include, in addition to persons running an operation that has contributed to environmental damage, persons controlling these operations as well. Those responsible are defined as “operators”.</p>
<p>Environmental liability means that each person referred to as an operator in the Directive is to be responsible to the general public, at their own initiative, in the manner prescribed by the Directive and without modification for reasons of fairness, though with certain exceptions, for taking and paying for the preventive and remedial measures required by the Directive in the event of serious environmental damage and imminent threats of such damage.</p>
<p>The strict environmental liability proposed, like the present liability of the Swedish Environmental Code, entails a greater obligation for the operator to provide information and greater demands for more precise remedial action and for procedures when taking decisions and undertaking such action.</p>
<p>It is proposed that the county administrative board, which should be immediately notified of any serious environmental damage, is to be responsible for deciding how such damage is to be remedied and to determine a plan of action for this. The examination is to be undertaken according to detailed instructions in an appendix to the Directive. These instructions and other guidelines for the examination are proposed to be included in a special ordinance on determining remedial action in the event of serious environmental damage. This ordinance is based on the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency being authorised to issue the more detailed instructions that will be necessary for their application.</p>
<p>The measures decided by the county administrative board are to be primarily directed at remedying serious environmental damage, which in principle requires that all significant risks for people’s health are removed and that, in the event of damage to water or to biological diversity, the environment is rehabilitated to its original state at the time the damage was incurred. If the environment cannot be rehabilitated at the damaged location, demands may arise for compensation for lost or damaged environmental values somewhere else.</p>
<p>It is proposed that the regulations on the new liability for environmental damage, which will not become statute-barred, are only to apply to environmental damage that occurs after 30 April 2007.</p>
<h2>Piercing the corporate veil</h2>
<p>A regulation on piercing the corporate veil means that shareholders are given a form of personal liability for the company’s obligations. The question for the Inquiry has been whether such a regulation is needed in order to reach underlying stakeholders when an operating company does not manage to discharge its aftertreatment liability under Chapter 10 of the Swedish Environmental Code.</p>
<p>However, in our analysis of the circumstances it has not been possible to establish any clear practical need for such a regulation. For this reason we do not recommend a regulation on piercing the corporate veil. This notwithstanding, we still present a proposal of how such a regulation could be formulated if, for legal policy or other reasons, it were desirable to introduce one.</p>
<p>The proposed extension of the concept of operator necessary for implementing the Environmental Liability Directive reduces the need for a possible regulation on piercing the corporate veil.</p>
<p>We also point to the existing possibility of determining a kind of piercing of the corporate veil in those cases which, practically speaking, are most important. Discharge of after-treatment liability can be ensured by applying Chapter 16, Section 3 of the Swedish Environmental Code by making permits for operations conditional on guarantees to this effect by the parent company.</p>
<h2>Financial guarantees</h2>
<p>We consider that the obligation to lodge guarantees prescribed in Article 14 of the Mining Waste Directive can be covered by the current text of the provision on waste disposal in Chapter 15, Section 34 of the Swedish Environmental Code. With regard to the obligation to lodge guarantees under this provision, we propose no amendment other than that, like the other provisions of the Swedish Environmental Code on lodging guarantees in Chapter 9, Section 6 a and Chapter 16, Section 3, an exemption for central government, municipalities, county councils and associations of local authorities is to apply.</p>
<p>With regard to guarantees as such, we propose a regulation common to all three provisions based on the possibility of evaluating guarantees freely without formal limitations and on the size of the guarantee being adjusted to the actual need for it.</p>
<p>We thus propose that all the usual forms of guarantees in the financial market be accepted as guarantees at their assessed value in each individual case and that an applicant is to show that the guarantee offered is secure, i.e. that it is sufficient and otherwise acceptable for the intended purpose. We also propose that it should be possible, when conditions allow, to subsequently lodge a guarantee, consisting of several different types of guarantee that can be adjusted upwards or downwards according to the need in question.</p>
