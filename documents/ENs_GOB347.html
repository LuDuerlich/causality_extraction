<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>Sweden has changed dramatically from being a culturally homogeneous society to a society with diversity that has given our country a wealth we did not have earlier. Sweden is nowadays a part of the world. Today almost 20 percent of the inhabitants come from other countries and other cultures. It is very important that our country takes advantage of this diversity. We must create conditions in Sweden where people with different ethnic background live and work together on equal conditions and in respect for each other´s individuality. This is the greatest joint task for our country at the moment.</p>
<p>In a welfare state like ours we believe in social equality and the individual ´ s right to take part of the welfare of society. However, today the difference in living conditions between various groups is big – and growing – and there are signs of an emerging class society where ethniticity becomes a differentiating factor. Because of differences in traditions and ways of thinking in different countries and cultures – also bias and probably discrimination too – immigrants often have considerable barriers to overcome before they find good conditions for their lives in Sweden.</p>
<p>However, Sweden has a good chance of succeeding in creating a well working society by taking advantage of the possibilities that diversity gives. There is no time to lose. Political focus on diversity is needed. Resources are needed for the measures we suggest in this report. Without supplementary resources the problem of diversity in higher education cannot be solved. The circumstance that the economy is growing, because of the boom, gives the government a unique opportunity to promote efforts in education, on all levels, which strengthens the opportunities for success.</p>
<p>Education gives opportunities to equalize differences and increase understanding between individuals and groups. Education also gives the individual better chances to take part in social life and on the labour market. Everybody ought to have the same opportunity to take part in education. It is a common opinion that the compulsory school that was initiated in the 19 th  century was of great importance. The literacy and educational attainment level was an important cause of Sweden´s successful change into an industrialand later on a welfare state. Today the demands are much higher when it comes to knowledge, and higher education is needed for many of the professions in question. Higher education is not compulsory to everybody, but in practice it is necessary. It is a very important issue to make higher education attractive and see to it that everyone who has the qualifications to enter higher education and an interest in doing so also will have a chance to obtain such an education. The goal is that 50 percent of an annual cohort of pupils will begin higher education before twentyfive years of age, compared to about 30 percent today. The number of students in higher education has increased very much during the last ten years. Today they are more than 300.000 and the number increases. At the same time the demand for higher education has not increased. Especially not within science and technology, which the government wishes.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The commission has worked according to its terms of reference in an action oriented way and has used already existing knowledge. The commission has also carried out interviews, discussions, studies and seminars. They have given a picture of the social and ethnic diversity in higher education and also the measures taken with the aim of increasing it. The commission has completed existing material with three studies of its own: An interview study with students from the University College of Halmstad, a study with students from Lund University and a study of essays written by upper secondary school pupils about their future encounter with and expectation of higher education .  The results of these studies are described in the report but there is also a summary in appendices that can be read separately. A special study about different EU projects aiming at increased social and ethnic diversity in higher education has been carried out. The commission has continuously been informed about other relevant studies and projects. One is the diversity project in the Ministry of Industry another is the study done by The National Agency for Higher Education, an evaluation of different quality aspects, among them social and ethnic diversity. The agency´s assessment is based on material provided by most higher education institutions in Sweden. The commission has used it as empirical material.</p>
<p>Important starting points for the commission are firstly, that higher education plays a main role in today´s development of society and it is important that higher education reflects the social and ethnic diversity in society. Higher education must, however, also take the role of being at the centre of society. Secondly, we discuss many of the ambiguous and in many cases controversial definitions that must be used when approaching the question about social and ethnic diversity in higher education.</p>
<h2>Diversity in higher education</h2>
<p>A wider access to higher education has been discussed and studied during the 20 th  century. Several steps have also been taken and the result over a period of time shows some social equalization in access to higher education. In short the research shows the following. The general social equalization in society during 1930 – 1970 has reduced the social impact on educational opportunity, and the fact that the educational inequality has resisted further change is because it is deeply rooted in the socioeconomic and sociocultural structure of society. Especially the level of educational attainment of the home and the parents´ educational awareness and support influences the participation rate in higher education.</p>
<p>During the second half of the 20 th  century Sweden has developed into a multicultural society. The guiding star for the new politics of cultural integration that has developed during the 90´s is maintaining of cultural diversity and the right for the individual to choose cultural affiliation .  In the research about diversity identity is a main issue, both the changed identity of the Swedish society during the second half of the 20 th  century when it developed into a multicultural society, and the cultural identity of the individual. When looking at higher education in the light of the ethnic diversity of society we point out three branches of special importance: Diversity among students and staff, that ought to reflect the diversity in society; the importance of higher education in a multicultural society as its reflexive quality can help cultural understanding; and the increased value of critically and independently thinking individuals in the tension field formed by the individual, group and society.</p>
<p>The socially biased recruitment to higher education remains. The probability that an individual with academic background will pass on to higher education is six to seven times higher than that of an individual with working class background. Half of the students in higher education are academics of first generation, while half of them have an academic background. This means that higher education is both an arena for social mobility and academic selfreproduction.</p>
<p>When it comes to the ethnic recruitment to higher education knowledge is limited and there is a great need of research about the relation between higher education and ethniticy. The few Swedish studies that have thrown light upon the relationship between ethniticy and social background in the transition to higher education stress that the social background is the strongest factor. This is also confirmed by international studies. The amount of students with foreign background in higher education is approximately the same as in the population as a whole, but analyses are missing that would make it possible to show differences in transition rates between different ethnic groups. The segregation and marginalization that is characteristic of the situation for many immigrants in Sweden tends to create an ethnic lowerclass and this fact most certainly influences the transition to higher education.</p>
<p>The commission has assembled statistics showing the ethnic diversity in higher education staff. In proportion to the total population persons born abroad are overrepresented among the staff. This category does not only consist of immigrants but also of people from other countries that are active in higher education for a shorter time e.g. as visiting research fellows. This category is assumed to be quite big which is indicated by the fact that 10 percent of the staff in higher education have foreign citizenship (in the population the corresponding group is 5 percent). When it comes to persons with two parents born abroad the percentage among the staff in higher education corresponds to that of persons of working age but it is less than the total population. The amount of persons with one parent born abroad is the same as in the population (the age bracket 16–64). This means that the percentage of ethnic multigeneration Swedes in higher education is less than in the total population. If we compare with the amount of the population that is of working age the difference is a little less. There are differences between universities and university colleges. Many more persons have a foreign background at the universities. The big difference is that there are many more persons born abroad at universities than in higher education. There is a European dominance among those born abroad in the population as well as among the staff in higher education institutions. The amount born in Asia and Africa is less among the staff in higher education than in the total population.</p>
<p>The distribution of persons with foreign background is uneven as to different positions in higher education. The largest amount with foreign background is found among research staff while the amount among teaching staff is less. The smallest amount is found in administration. Research is international, teaching is more ”Swedish” and administration is very Swedish. The largest amount of persons with foreign background is found in the category cleaning and economy staff, far down in the hierarchy. The conclusion of this is that persons with foreign background have a problem making a career in higher education.</p>
<p>In summary the ethnic and social diversity in higher education can be described like this. Higher education is embedded in society but to a minor degree multisocial, it is international but to a minor degree multicultural. Comparing universities with university colleges the former can be said to be less multisocial and more international while the latter is more multisocial and less international.</p>
<h2>Diversity in education and learning</h2>
<p>The educational system at large and higher education in particular has grown considerably in recent years. Besides, the goal for higher education is continuing growth. Education is very often described as a necessity in the so-called knowledge society. Education has become part of a norm in our society. The essays the upper secondary school pupils have written for the commission show that they experience education as a duty. They have to attend education to be able to get a profession. The socially biased recruitment to higher education is put into a completely different light when education becomes a necessity .  It then appears as more dangerous than earlier that someone is rejected from education, not least as education today, much more than earlier, decides individual social affiliation in a way that resembles the role that salaried work had earlier. Accordingly lack of education will be the same as unemployment with all negative sides, not least when it comes to social affiliation, individual integration and identity.</p>
<p>When education becomes a norm the higher education students in many ways become more differentiated than earlier. If we assume that earlier selection, that created a relatively exclusive group of students, also meant a similarity in motive, intelligence etc, in all less diversity, the present situation results in a great diversity in many different ways. Our conclusion is that higher education must put more energy on educational upgrading among teachers to be able to handle this diversity better. Also higher education has to take a bigger responsibility to introduce the students in higher education settings.</p>
<h2>Diversity in quality work</h2>
<p>The quality work that has grown within higher education during the last century can be seen as a necessary answer to the tendencies of decrease of quality. Higher education must in the present situation, at the same time, secure quality in a more differentiated and diversified population of students. At the same time higher education has to learn how to handle diversity in order to increase quality</p>
<p>In the report the definition of quality is discussed and different dimensions of quality in higher education are pointed out. Starting from these dimensions of quality we show how diversity itself can contribute to higher quality. When it comes to the research quality diversity can be used to make an already existing diversity of scientific perspectives still more diversified. Experiences from other parts of the world than Europe and North America enriches research and education. In educational quality scientific diversity of perspectives is also of great importance. Multicultural competence becomes more important on a labour market that is more and more characterised by a globalised economy. Ethnic diversity contributes to increased quality among students and teachers. Identification in the learning process is of great value and for this reason gender, ethnic and social diversity among the teachers in higher education increases the possibilities of a more diversified group of students to find persons to identify themselves with. When it comes to the economic/administrative quality dimension we have found that within the smallest amount of persons with foreign background is the category administrative staff. An increase of the amount of immigrants as administrators in higher education can contribute to better economic/administrative quality. A consciousness of the special resources and problems that characterizes a non-traditional background in higher education can improve administrative routines, everyday distribution of resources, linguistic, physical and social accessibility in higher education. We think that as to social quality increased diversity can contribute to higher social quality because a social and cultural mixture is good. This is especially important taking the students´ further lives and careers into consideration, in the multicultural society in general and particularly in professions where one meets people with many different backgrounds. Social and cultural mixture in higher education contributes to a multicultural and multisocial understanding and reduces ethnic prejudices and class prejudices. Finally an increase in ethnic and social diversity contributes to the societal quality of higher education, since it´s legitimacy increases in society.</p>
<h2>Reflections and suggestions</h2>
<p>Sweden has an important, unused resource in the potential students that do not apply to higher education today, because of different reasons, assignable to ethnic and social factors. It is of greatest importance for society to make higher education institutions more active in recruiting these individuals, and then to get these potential students to actively apply to higher education – and when they are there – to be comfortable and be able to carry on their studies successfully.</p>
<p>Resources are needed for higher education to be able to take energetic measures to promote diversity. Therefore diversity in higher education must be a concentrated and sustainable priority, to start with as a project for five years. During this time higher education shall build a lasting system to increase diversity – ethnically and socially. During this time various measures can be tried by different universities and university colleges. The government should allocate considerable amounts – up to 500 millions SEK a year – from which university and university colleges can receive support for development work and pilot projects during the five year period. An evaluation of the project should be done by the end of the period.</p>
<p>The commission suggests the following measures to be taken:</p>
<p>· Compulsory introductory course for all new students. (The model for this will be evaluated in a pilot project at ten universities during a period of five years).</p>
<p>· A preparatory term to widen the recruitment base in higher education.</p>
<p>· A special scholarship connected to the preparatory term.</p>
<p>· Elective courses in the Swedish language in the introductory course</p>
<p>· Special support to students to learn Swedish language.</p>
<p>· University courses in the Swedish language for immigrant academics.</p>
<p>· More flexible selection rules and procedures combined with active recruitment efforts for ethnic and social diversity.</p>
<p>· Special labour market measures for foreign academics.</p>
<p>· A goal for recruiting staff in higher education in terms of ethnic diversity.</p>
<p>· Appointment boards to enable fair assessment of applicants with part of their academic career abroad.</p>
<p>· Action plans for social and ethnic diversity in higher education.</p>
<p>· Diversity as a criteria in quality assessment.</p>
<p>· Resources for pedagogical diversity management.</p>
<p>· Multidisciplinary research program about diversity in higher education.</p>
