<h1>Summary</h1>

<p>The Committee on Testing and Conformity Assessment was assigned to evaluate the Swedish open system of testing and conformity assessment. Overall, this assignment is twofold. It involves, first, monitoring and evaluating the workings of the existing open system and, second, analysing how use of open systems can be developed further.</p>
<p>Structure of the open system</p>
<p>Inspection based on open systems means that independent, autonomous bodies perform conformity assessment in competition. ‘Conformity assessment’ of a product or suchlike means the procedure for checking that the product meets existing requirements.</p>
<p>Testing and assessment often take place on a voluntary basis. In Sweden as in many other countries there are also, however, mandatory rules of public law governing product design and inspection. These mandatory rules exist within the sectors of 20-odd central government ‘regulatory agencies’.</p>
<p>From the mid-1970s, Sweden applied a system of national testing sites for compulsory testing and conformity assessment. These sites had a monopoly of all testing prescribed by various public agencies within the sites’ respective catchment areas. During the 1990s, major changes took place. In preparation for Sweden’s accession to the EEA, the Swedish Parliament (Riksdag) decided to discontinue the national testing-site system. Instead, Sweden’s mandatory conformity assessment was to be based on the new principles that had begun to be introduced in the European Community a few years before.</p>
<p>Free movement of goods is one basic principle of EU cooperation. To facilitate this, Member States’ requirements</p>
<p>concerning product design have, in many cases, been harmonised by means of various product directives. Where the EU has not yet drawn up uniform regulations, the principle of mutual recognition is applied. The premise for this principle is that a Member State must approve a product from another Member State if the product concerned meets product requirements in the home country.</p>
<p>Product directives have been drawn up according to two different legislative methods. Directives drawn up according to the Old Approach normally specify complete specifications that the products must fulfil. These directives of which just over 700 are still in force are thus highly detailed in technical terms. From the mid-1980s, the New Approach to technical harmonisation was applied. Directives drawn up according to the New Approach some 25 to date specify only basic safety requirements. Detailed specifications are, instead, found in technical standards drawn up according to the current routines for standardisation work and altered in line with technological development. However, these standards are not mandatory: the detailed technical requirements can be met in other ways as well.</p>
<p>For the Old Approach, there is no uniform procedure for testing and assessment. Instead, each directive specifies sometimes for groups of directives which procedures are to be observed before products are released on the market. Requirements concerning mandatory type inspection by a type-approval agency are sometimes imposed.</p>
<p>Parallel to the introduction of the New Approach, however, the European system of conformity assessment has also been reformed. This has been done through introduction of the Global Approach, which is now the norm for product areas harmonised by means of the New Approach. Compulsory advance approvals by public agencies have been abolished within the product areas concerned. Instead, the main rule in the Global Approach is that manufacturers themselves can certify that their products fulfil the requirements imposed in the directives concerned. In some cases, however, the manufacturer is required to have a certified quality system or assign to an independent inspection body (a ‘notified body’) the task of assessing, before a product is released on the market, whether it meets essential requirements. Notified bodies are those that a Member State has deemed competent to perform testing, assessment or certification under a particular product directive, and that has been notified to the EU by the Member</p>
<p>State for such tasks. Under the New Approach Directives, there are approximately 2,000 notified bodies, some 50 of which are Swedish. In the Global Approach, these notified bodies compete with one another in an open system. Official supervision of product conformity to the prescribed requirements takes place in the Global Approach, primarily through market surveillance.</p>
<p>Before Sweden’s accession to the EEA, Parliament decided that an open system should be applied as the principal rule for testing and conformity assessment in Sweden, both in the areas harmonised through various EC directives (the ‘harmonised sector’) and in the areas where Sweden can decide independently how to organise assessment (the ‘non-harmonised sector’). The areas in which Sweden can decide, for the most part independently, concern requirements of assessment before products are launched on the market, when it comes to new products not covered by EC directives, and recurrent inspections. A ‘recurrent inspection’ means, broadly, an inspection of various types of installation, such as lifts, that takes place annually or at other intervals.</p>
<p>An open system has not, however, been introduced for all testing and conformity assessment regulated in public law. Certain product areas harmonised by means of the Old Approach, such as compulsory advance testing of motor vehicles, are based on the premise that, for each directive, Member States should designate special assessment bodies. Thus, open systems are not intended for these product areas. Some sectors have also been exempted by the Government from the main rule on open systems. The most prominent example is periodic vehicle testing, where Parliament has decided that AB Svensk Bilprovning should have a monopoly.</p>
<p>In each sector, the sector authority in charge is responsible for implementing and following up EC product directives and monitoring safety issues. These agencies are generally entitled to issue their own regulations imposing compulsory requirements, regulated in public law, governing product design and inspection. In the harmonised sector such agency regulations serve mainly to assist Swedish implementation of EC regulations. Before agencies issue regulations on testing and conformity assessment, they must consult the Swedish Board for Accreditation and Conformity Assessment (SWEDAC).</p>
<p>Bodies wishing to compete for testing or assessment assignments in the open system must, in general, meet certain prescribed competence requirements. In the harmonised sector, they must be</p>
<p>designated as notified bodies. In the non-harmonised sector, the regulatory agencies usually state that the bodies concerned must be accredited for the function under the Act (1992:1119) on technical conformity assessment. However, such requirements are often, but not always, supplemented by rules that bodies accredited under corresponding provisions in other EEA member countries may also be considered. Other models, too, may qualify: there are, for example, areas in which the provider of the service concerned must be certified for the task by an accredited certification body. The competence requirements for designation as a notified or accredited body are based mainly on applicable standards. However, a regulatory agency is entitled to issue regulations imposing any special competence requirements that it deems necessary within its own sphere of activities.</p>
<p>SWEDAC, which is Sweden’s national accreditation body, is responsible for competence assessment, designation and continuous supervision of Swedish notified and accredited bodies alike. Before notified bodies are designated, SWEDAC must consult the public agencies concerned. ‘Accreditation’ is formal recognition that a body is competent to perform certain specified services, such as testing. At year-end 2005 there were more than 2,600 bodies with valid accreditation in Sweden.</p>
<p>In the EU, an overview has been under way for several years to improve implementation of the New Approach and the principle of mutual recognition. This overview is expected to result in draft regulations to be adopted by the European Commission just before year-end 2006 and submitted to the Council and European Parliament in early 2007. The definitive regulations should therefore be issued around mid-2008. Based on its findings to date, the Committee considers that the proposals should be well in line with the main features of the Swedish open system of testing and conformity assessment. Accordingly, only relatively small compulsory adjustments of the Swedish system are likely to be needed as a result of the overview. The Committee’s assessment does not include market surveillance, which it has deemed to be beyond the scope of its assignment.</p>
<p>Evaluation of the existing Swedish open system</p>
<p>Within the harmonised sector, Sweden cannot opt for any solutions regarding testing and conformity assessment other than those that are compatible with Community law. Therefore, the only substantial scope for reassessing present-day Swedish solutions regarding testing and conformity assessment is likely to be within the nationally regulated sector. How far such a reassessment is called for may, in turn, be assessed only in the light of the workings of the current system.</p>
<p>Given this background, the Committee has not found it worthwhile to attempt an entirely open-ended evaluation of the Swedish system of testing and conformity assessment, i.e. one based on the assumption that the whole of this system needs reassessing. Instead, the Committee has focused on seeking to assess how the existing Swedish open system of testing and conformity assessment works, and which problems exist in its implementation. In carrying out its evaluation, the Committee has considered sectors where an open system has been introduced, de facto, mainly in testing and conformity assessment but also in certain associated areas for assessment of conformity.</p>
<p>It is difficult to determine with certainty what the effects of introducing the open system have been. This is partly because development in the product areas concerned has, of course, been influenced by other factors as well during the ten years or so in which open systems have existed in Sweden. These factors include, for example, increasing globalisation and general technological and product development.</p>
<p>However, the overall assessment of the Committee is that the open system works well on the whole. There are also several reasons for believing that open systems are a rational method of organising assessment activities. Since open systems are based on competition between independent assessment bodies they can, for example, be assumed to promote efficiency. An ability to procure testing and assessment services in competition also presupposes that requirements concerning the services are verbalised, clarified and documented. Accordingly, in general, open systems are more transparent than ‘non-open’ ones. This makes it easier for stakeholders concerned to grasp which requirements actually exist.</p>
<p>Nor can the Committee discern any substantial disadvantages in using open systems. Experience from the sectors in which open</p>
<p>systems have been introduced shows, for example, that safety has not generally suffered as a result. In some product areas, the safety level seems rather to have improved in recent years. How far this can be ascribed to the introduction of open systems or is due to other causes is, however, uncertain. Moreover, the quality level of the testing and control conducted in the product areas concerned has, on the whole, remained unchanged following the introduction of open systems. Regarding the costs of testing and conformity assessment it is, admittedly, true that the costs incurred, especially by the agencies concerned, have not infrequently risen slightly as a result of open systems being introduced. Several agencies have explained this to the Committee with reference to increasing assessment activities and regulatory work performed by the agency in conjunction with the introduction of open systems. But the picture is unclear: there are also agencies that are of the opinion that costs have, rather, decreased after open systems have been introduced.</p>
<p>In its evaluation, the Committee has identified certain problems in the implementation of the open system of testing and conformity assessment (see the next section). In the Committee’s estimation, however, these problems are not of such a dramatic nature as to prompt a return to the model applied before the open system was introduced, nor to question the very basis of the principal rule on open systems that, in the early 1990s, Parliament adopted in preparation for Sweden joining the EEA.</p>
<p>Regarding several of the issues raised in the directives for the assignment, the Committee is also of the view that problems are, in practice lacking or that only limited problems exist. This applies to routines for consultation, information exchange and feedback in the open system, as well as to SWEDAC’s supervision of notified and accredited bodies. In addition, some of the problems observed by the Committee are expected to be soluble through measures that have been taken or are planned in other contexts. For example, the current EU overview of the New Approach is likely to deal with a criticism that has been put forward by various stakeholders: that the notified bodies of various Member States are of varying quality. In these cases, the Committee finds no need to propose any special measures.</p>
<p>Proposed improvements in the current open system</p>
<p>As explained above, the Committee considers that the problems observed in the implementation of the open system are not of such a kind as to prompt any dramatic changes in the present-day model. Within the framework of the existing basic structure, however, there is reason to make certain adjustments. In its report, the Committee cites several proposals with this focus. These may be summarised as follows.</p>
<p>In the compulsory sector in which testing and assessment are prescribed by public agencies the Technical Conformity Assessment Act presumably gives SWEDAC a de facto sole right in terms of the kind of accreditation covered by the Act. The Committee proposes making it clear in the Act that this sole right also covers the voluntary sector. Such an amendment would enhance the clarity and credibility of the accreditation and the open system, and is also in line with the anticipated outcome of the current EU overview. Thus, a forthcoming statute is expected to enjoin Member States to organise accreditation as the means of ensuring the technical competence, capability and impartiality of conformity assessment bodies. This is to be done by the Member State instituting and maintaining one national accreditation body to carry out accreditation regarding both compulsory and voluntary testing and assessment.</p>
<p>In the Committee’s estimation, coordination of regulatory agencies’ testing and conformity assessment can probably be improved in certain cases, especially with respect to recurrent inspections of various kinds. This should, for example, apply to such matters as regulations on formulation of assessment results, frequency of inspections and competence requirements for carrying out the prescribed testing and conformity assessment. Typically, the competence requirements in the Committee’s chosen terminology are twofold: they cover both basic competence (e.g. being an accredited assessment body) and specialist competence (e.g. some documented experience of the area concerned). One factor that has probably contributed to the coordination problems is that clear, overarching principles are lacking for determining which method of competence assessment should be used in various situations. In other words, it is unclear whether competence assessment of the bodies to carry out a particular service should, for example, take place directly through</p>
<p>accreditation or through certification performed by accredited certification bodies.</p>
<p>One practicable method of facilitating greater coordination among various regulatory agencies’ requirements should be an attempt to harmonise the basic competence requirements for all assessments that are stipulated for a single object, such as a building, that is subject to supervision. Based on this kind of ‘platform’, the bodies wishing to compete for these assessment assignments can then choose which, and how many, of the specialist skills they want to offer. The Committee has found that, for several years, SWEDAC has been making some efforts to develop a coordination method of this kind. According to the Committee, it is essential for this initiative to be reinforced. It is appropriate for SWEDAC to bear responsibility for pursuing this kind of development work, but the work must take place in close dialogue and collaboration with the regulatory agencies concerned. This is because assessing at a more concrete level whether, and if so how, the regulations of the agencies concerned can be further coordinated is a task that can primarily be performed by the agencies themselves.</p>
<p>As a starting point for further development of the open system, there is also a need to develop overarching general principles to govern the choice of which methods of competence assessment should be used in various situations. One such choice is to decide whether the competence assessment of bodies that are to perform particular services should take place directly through accreditation or through certification carried out by accredited certification bodies. The Committee proposes that the Government should assign SWEDAC to draft general principles of this kind. This assignment should include surveying which methods of competence assessment are used at present in various sectors, which reasons have been cited for using these methods and which effects they may be assumed to have. It should also include analysing suitable criteria for selecting methods of competence assessment. The assignment should also include the task of identifying, on the basis of the survey of competence-assessment methods used at present, specific areas in which regulatory agencies’ requirements can be further coordinated, and also embarking on discussions on this matter with the agencies concerned.</p>
<p>The Committee wishes to emphasise that companies and other organisations that have voluntarily obtained certification for their</p>
<p>systems of managing quality, the work environment or the outdoor environment, for example, seldom appear to be subjected to less extensive official supervision than supervised organisations that lack such certification. In the Committee’s view, this may indicate that the supervisory agencies underestimate the importance of such certification. By the same token, they may also fail to make use of the scope for differentiating the focus and extent of supervision that certification of this kind, in the Committee’s view, probably entails. However, the Committee has been unable to survey in detail how far voluntary certification of management systems, covering such aspects as quality, the work environment or the outdoor environment, currently exists in various sectors and the importance attributed to it by individual supervisory agencies. Therefore, the Committee proposes that the Government should undertake a special investigation of these issues. This investigation should also include analysis of the role that such certification may and should play in terms of supervision in the future, for example, how it may or should affect the scope for differentiating the focus and extent of supervision.</p>
<p>In its work, the Committee has encountered several cases where regulatory agencies apply open systems, but in their regulations still state that only bodies accredited by SWEDAC are eligible for (at least some of) the assessment assignments covered by the agency’s regulations. In these cases, the regulations thus do not make it clear that the assignments may in accordance with the principle of mutual recognition be performed by competent bodies from other EU Member States and EEA member countries. The fact that, in some cases, clauses on mutual recognition are lacking has been noted on several occasions in the Government Offices and also by, for example, the National Board of Trade and SWEDAC. Despite measures implemented to date, however, further action appears necessary. Accordingly, the Committee proposes that the Government should assign each regulatory agency concerned to insert explicit clauses on mutual recognition into its regulations, where such clauses are lacking at present. Clauses of this kind have several advantages, in the Committee’s view. First, the agency thereby shows that it is actually aware that mutual recognition applies. Secondly, the assessment bodies’ customers concerned are better informed that mutual recognition applies, and this should increase their range of options.</p>
<p>The regulations governing accreditation activities, notably the Technical Conformity Assessment Act and Ordinance and also SWEDAC’s regulations, currently lack effective scope for sanctions against anyone who unlawfully claims accreditation or the status of a notified body. Therefore, the Committee proposes inserting into the Technical Conformity Assessment Act a penalty charge for the purpose of tackling such problems. This charge should be applied in the event of contravention in the compulsory and voluntary sectors alike.</p>
<p>The Committee proposes inserting some scope for appeal into the Technical Conformity Assessment Act. Thus, the Committee considers that an explicit rule should be inserted to the effect that decisions concerning designation of notified bodies may be appealed to a general administrative court. Moreover, in the Committee’s view SWEDAC should be made responsible for cancelling notification of bodies to the EU, and scope for lodging appeals against such decisions with a general administrative court should simultaneously be introduced.</p>
<p>Use of open systems in other areas</p>
<p>Assessment procedures based on open systems mean that independent and autonomous bodies assess conformity on a competitive basis. Theoretically, in the Committee’s view, only one criterion needs to be fulfilled for an open system to be applicable to the assessment procedure in a particular area. This criterion is that it must be possible to define a standard whereby the person carrying out the inspection can assess conformity. This standard must be so precisely defined that assessors using it can, independently of one another, arrive at the same result. For a standard of this kind to be defined, the requirements imposed must be verbalised, clarified and documented. This can be done most simply by reference to normative standards, but it may also take place in other ways.</p>
<p>As we have seen above, the Committee considers open systems to be a rational method of organising assessment activities, and that the existing open system works well on the whole. Neither can the Committee see any substantial disadvantages of using open systems. Accordingly, the Committee is of the opinion that open systems should, as a main rule, be used in all assessment activities</p>
<p>where this is possible. In the Committee’s view it should theoretically be feasible to define the requisite standard and thereby use open systems in all situations where inspections take place in relation to a defined set of specifications, i.e. in principle as part of all types of supervision, irrespective of specialist area.</p>
<p>If open systems are to be used as a tool in public supervision it is, however, essential to note two points. First, this kind of procedure should normally be based on independent third-party bodies carrying out the actual inspections only. Second, the exercise of official authority e.g. the taking of sanction decisions prompted by shortcomings revealed by an inspection should, on the other hand, remain a government agency’s function.</p>
<p>Ruling that open systems must always be used in such activities would not, however, be appropriate in the Committee’s view. This is because in an individual case there may be circumstances of various kinds that, in a balanced assessment, prompt the conclusion that open systems should not be used. One such circumstance may be that it is not deemed likely, in the area concerned, that a reasonably well-functioning market of independent third-party bodies can be set up. Other circumstances that may make using open systems inappropriate may, for example, be that strict secrecy requirements apply in the area concerned and that these are considered difficult to preserve in an open system. It must, moreover, be noted that, in certain areas, an active policy of not using open systems has been adopted by the Government and/or in the EU. For example, assessment procedures in certain product areas in the EU that have been harmonised by means of the Old Approach are not intended for open systems. However, this does not mean that open systems are, by definition, unusable in these product areas. What it means is that, with the current procedure, they are not intended for open systems.</p>
<p>Assessing whether it is suitable, in an individual case, to use an open system therefore requires in-depth analysis adjusted to the specific situation concerned. With the overall perspective that has applied to its assignment, however, the Committee has not been able to perform in-depth analyses, adjusted to specific situations, in order to introduce open systems in individual sectors. Accordingly, the Committee’s evaluation of the existing Swedish open system’s implementation and functioning has primarily had the system level, and not individual areas, as its starting point.</p>
<p>In the light of the above considerations, the Committee considers that the main rule regarding open systems that was adopted by the Swedish Parliament prior to Sweden’s signing of the EEA Agreement should be consolidated and clarified. The premise for this should be that open systems should, as a primary rule, be used as the method of organising assessment in all supervision that includes inspections in relation to a defined set of specifications.</p>
<p>Consequently, in the Committee’s opinion, central government agencies and public inquiries alike should become subject to a general requirement to consider open systems as a method of supervisory activity. The Committee is of the opinion that, along with this requirement, there should be a presumption that open systems must be used. Accordingly, in a case where an agency or public inquiry thinks that open systems cannot or should not be used, the onus should in principle be on the agency or inquiry concerned to show why this is so.</p>
<p>The Committee considers that a clarification of the current main rule, as described above, should appropriately take place through a statement of principle on the part of Parliament.</p>
<p>To clarify the scope of the main rule that the Committee considers should apply, the Committee also proposes that the Act on technical conformity assessment should be renamed.</p>
