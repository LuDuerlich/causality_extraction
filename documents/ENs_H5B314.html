<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Remit</h2>
<p>The Inquiry was tasked with surveying and describing the current division of responsibilities, organisation and financing of migration activities at missions abroad. Against the background of this survey, the Inquiry is to assess the extent to which the current system provides the conditions for cost-effective, flexible and in other respects fit-for-purpose activities, look into alternatives to the current system as well as their advantages and disadvantages, propose how the division of responsibilities, organisation and financing could, if possible, be made more fit-for-purpose and cost-effective, and investigate the legal and other conditions for implementing the proposals presented and estimate the costs of these.</p>
<h2>The Inquiry’s assessment</h2>
<p>The Inquiry’s assessment is that the interaction between the Swedish Migration Agency and missions abroad reveals functional shortcomings and therefore needs improving. In some areas, the division of responsibilities is unclear and needs clarifying. Staff policy is based on a system of leave of absence and temporary appointments that is less than optimal.</p>
<p>The Inquiry has considered whether a clearer main responsibility for the processing of migration issues at missions abroad should be placed with the Ministry for Foreign Affairs or the Migration Agency. This question is not new – it has actually been considered on some ten occasions over the past 25 years. Like the majority of these previous assessment bodies, the Inquiry has found strong arguments in favour of entrusting management responsibility to the Migration Agency. A reformed model for responsibility and financing should be able to stimulate more active international monitoring and more intensive development work. It should therefore be able to promote renewal and help ensure that use is made of potential rationalisation gains.</p>
<h2>The Inquiry’s proposals General comments about the Inquiry’s proposals</h2>
<p>The main responsibility for migration activities at the missions abroad should be placed with the Swedish Migration Agency. This proposal involves the Migration Agency being given responsibility for the resources for activities and the allocation of these resources. The Migration Agency is already the central administrative agency responsible for issues concerning residence permits, work permits, visas, reception of asylum seekers, returns to countries of origin, citizenship and repatriation. The Agency also has responsibility for coordinating case processes. By giving the Migration Agency resource responsibility for processing at missions abroad as well, a clear link is created between responsibility, resources, management of processes and measurement, analysis and improvement of activities. This should provide better conditions and incentives in efforts to achieve greater efficiency and quality throughout migration activities, regardless of whether they are conducted abroad or in Sweden.</p>
<p>The tasks of processing and taking decisions on visa applications, as well as receiving and investigating applications for residence and work permits, will remain at missions abroad. As missions abroad come under the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in administrative terms, this Ministry will also continue to play an important role. Heads of mission will still have ultimate responsibility for the decisions taken at missions abroad. In the event of appeals in visa matters, they retain their position as opposite party in the migration court.</p>
<p>The proposal means that issues concerning migration linked to foreign and aid policy and political reporting remain at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, whereas responsibility for migration policy and migration administration is entrusted to the Migration Agency and the Ministry of Justice.</p>
<h2>Staff and premises</h2>
<p>Under the proposal, the Migration Agency is responsible for providing staff for migration activities at missions abroad. Following consultation with the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, the Migration Agency should place migration officers at missions abroad with such comprehensive migration activities as to require at least one annual full-time equivalent employee. At these missions, the Migration Agency’s employees should also be responsible for work and quality management, following delegation by the head of mission. If activities are less comprehensive, various solutions can be used, such as the Migration Agency buying in resources from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in the form of part-time positions, or processing and decision-making being concentrated at the Migration Agency. Another solution is that some missions abroad are given regional responsibility, while applicants receive service locally, in some cases via a service provider. Migration officers’ salaries, accommodation, travel and expenses are paid for by the Migration Agency.</p>
<p>This proposal should increase the chances of coordinated recruitment and a holistic approach to what kind of staffing Sweden needs abroad for migration activities. This applies, for example, to considerations about whether more processing can be done in Sweden, while resources are used to a greater extent to place experts on ID issues or other specialists abroad. In addition, the conditions for continuing professional development and preparation for those posted abroad will improve when the main responsibility for resources and activities is gathered within one and the same authority. This reform will facilitate the continued development of working procedures and methods within these activities. Electronic applications have already resulted in major change, and another technique that has been successfully tested by other countries is the remote interview.</p>
<p>Under the proposal, locally employed staff working on migration issues will retain their employment at the mission abroad, but the Migration Agency will pay the costs. The Agency will also ensure that the locally employed staff have the right skills for their duties. Under the proposal, administrative services for migration activities, as well as premises and overheads, will be paid for by the Migration Agency. This cooperation, as well as routines for human resources provision and terms of employment, should be regulated in an administrative agreement between the parties.</p>
<h2>Support, management and financing</h2>
<p>Missions abroad need support in their day-to-day work, as well as to develop and improve their operations. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs, which is currently the responsible authority for all activities at missions abroad, does not have the same opportunities as the Migration Agency to support, develop and follow up issues concerning the processing of administrative matters. Nor is it appropriate for such tasks to come under the Government Offices, which is primarily the Government’s processing body. The Inquiry therefore proposes that the Migration Agency, as a central administrative agency, should be responsible for the support, management, development and follow-up of migration activities at missions abroad.</p>
<p>As part of the proposal, the funds for migration activities at missions abroad will be transferred from the Government Offices to the Migration Agency. To promote a holistic approach and an overall assessment of the resource needs, and to facilitate the Government’s management in the area of migration, the funds will be transferred to expenditure area 8 Migration. A new appropriation should be established under expenditure area 8 for migration activities at missions abroad. This means that the Migration Agency will have an overall cost responsibility for the entire administrative area. In the Inquiry’s view, this will result in strengthened incentives to continuously examine whether the resources are being used well and whether there is a good balance between various measures.</p>
<h2>Consultation and cost-sharing</h2>
<p>The proposal means that the parties must regularly consult on various issues and that the costs of the activities are divided between the Migration Agency and the Ministry for Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p>Activity planning for the Migration Agency/Ministry of Justice and missions abroad/Ministry for Foreign Affairs needs to be integrated into the new system, which requires cooperation and communication between the parties. Integrated activity planning is needed to be able to make a politically coherent assessment and achieve consensus as a basis for action in a country, but also to be able to plan activities in terms of staffing, premises, administration, etc.</p>
<h2>Head of mission’s responsibility and principles for delegation</h2>
<p>Under the proposal, the head of mission continues to have ultimate responsibility for migration activities at a mission abroad. However, he or she will normally delegate the statutory task of taking decisions in visa matters to staff posted abroad from the Migration Agency. Other tasks that, as a rule, will be delegated are the day-to-day work management and monitoring of migration activities in the form of personal development dialogues and salary reviews for migration officers and locally employed staff. Issues and decisions of an overarching nature or that concern relations with the host country will continue to be referred to the head of mission.</p>
<p>The proposal means that the head of mission will still be responsible for security and the work environment of all staff at a mission abroad. However, the Migration Agency bears the cost of security measures that are necessary as a result of migration activities at the mission abroad. The Migration Agency also pays for work environment measures in relation to the staff it posts to the mission. Security and work environment issues should be dealt with within the framework of consultations between the Government Offices and the Migration Agency. This should be stated in the administrative agreement between the parties.</p>
<h2>Consequences of the proposals</h2>
<p>In the short term, and in terms of state finances, the proposal will have very limited consequences: appropriations that are currently channelled via one expenditure area will in future be channelled via another instead, and staff that are currently granted leave of absence in one part of the government administration to instead work in another part of it will in future be offered a higher degree of continuity in their employment. Certain additional resources will be needed to build up better management capacity at the Migration Agency.</p>
<p>In the long term, the proposal will enable better demand-driven and more rational use of state resources. Functions that are currently carried out at many locations abroad could to a certain extent be regionalised or returned to government agencies in Sweden. Cost savings through new technologies should also be facilitated. Clear main responsibility at one single agency should enable development capacity to be increased. The report also stresses the need for better reaction capacity at Riksdag and Government level. All the evidence suggests that the choice of objectives and funding in migration policy will, in future, require continuous political attention.</p>
