<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>The Swedish Inquiry on Child Abuse and Neglect in Institutions and Foster Homes (called the Abuse and Neglect Inquiry below) was only initiated, as in several other countries, after people told their stories to the media about their experiences of exploitation and abuse during their stay in children’s homes or foster homes. The TV documentary ‘ Stulen Barndom’ (Stolen Childhood),  where six middle-aged men told their stories about systematic violations, violence and sexual abuse during their stay at Skärsbo boys’ institution in Alingsås, was broadcast in November 2005. This documentary gave rise to the appointment of the Abuse and Neglect Inquiry in 2006.</p>
<h2>Interim report and the Inquiry on Redress for Past Abuse</h2>
<p>The Inquiry presented its interim report ‘ Vanvård i social barnavård under 1900-talet’ ( Child abuse and neglect in institutions and foster homes during the 20 th  century ) in January 2010. As a direct result of this, the Government appointed the Inquiry on Redress for Past Abuse, which was tasked with proposing how redress for these people could be designed. The Redress Inquiry presented its report to the Government in February 2011. Its proposals consisted of a three-part process; recognition of what had happened and an apology, compensation to those who had suffered, and measures to prevent it from happening again. The Redress</p>
<p>Inquiry’s proposals are currently under preparation at the Government Offices (September 2011).</p>
<h2>The purpose of the final report</h2>
<p>The purpose of the final report is to present a more detailed account of the results, where individual people and their stories are given more prominence than in the interim report. The ambition has also been to discuss how it was possible for the interviewees to be abused as children, and how similar unsatisfactory conditions for children in institutions and foster homes can be avoided in the future.</p>
<h2>The structure of the final report</h2>
<p>The Inquiry’s material includes various types of descriptions, accounts of interviews, recorded interviews, written descriptions of the children’s lives, archive documents, judgments and newspaper articles. This variety of material provides an insight into the context in which the child abuse and neglect took place, and knowledge about the vulnerable situation in which children and young people in institutions and foster homes found themselves.</p>
<p>The first two chapters are intended to give the reader an understanding of the framework within which the Inquiry has worked. A more detailed description of the Inquiry’s remit, constraints and choice of methods is to be found in the Inquiry’s interim report.</p>
<p>The contents and significance of the archive documents are discussed in Chapter 3.</p>
<p>Chapter 4 begins with a statistical report of the abuse and neglect that were registered. This is followed by seven accounts that describe, in different ways, experiences of abuse and neglect and various circumstances related to the children’s placement.</p>
<p>The Inquiry has drawn attention to the accounts of several of the interviewees from the same foster home or institution. The structures, similarities and differences that can be found in their stories are analysed in Chapter 5.</p>
<p>Chapter 6 discusses how archive material can naturally verify, but never prove false what an interviewed person has described.</p>
<p>Through the stories told by those interviewed, we also gained insights into how their adult lives turned out after their placement. There is a discussion on this in Chapter 7.</p>
<p>Chapter 8 deals with the significance of the interview for those interviewed. The responses to a questionnaire submitted by all those interviewed are also reported.</p>
<p>Using all the material and experiences gained by the Inquiry, Chapter 9 is devoted to reflections on how this abuse and neglect could occur, factors that may have contributed to it and a discussion on ways in which security for children and young people in institutions and foster homes can be strengthened.</p>
<h2>The frameworks of the Inquiry</h2>
<p>The Inquiry primarily conducted interviews in order to collect information on abuse and neglect. Participation in the interviews was voluntary on the part of the interviewee, and no activities to reach out to the persons concerned took place. The majority of the interviews were conducted in the Inquiry’s premises in Stockholm. Around one-third of the interviews took place in Gothenburg or Malmö. Where the interviewees were disabled or, for other reasons, unable to leave their homes, the interviews were conducted in their homes. Telephone interviews were avoided, but took place on one occasion. All the interviews were recorded. In connection with each interview, a written summary was drawn up, which the interviewees approved and in several cases, supplemented themselves. Only then was the abuse and neglect described classified and entered into the Inquiry’s database. The Inquiry also offered to search the archive documents of those interviewed where they themselves had not already done so at the time of the interview.</p>
<p>In connection with the interviews, those interviewed were also offered eight counselling support sessions with authorised psychotherapists via the St Lukas Organisation, which operates throughout the country. The purpose of these counselling support sessions was to provide an opportunity for the interviewee to deal with the thoughts and feelings that emerged as a result of the interview.</p>
<h2>866 interviews</h2>
<p>All in all, the Inquiry was in touch with some 2 000 people, who considered that they had been the victims of abuse and neglect in institutions and foster homes, or who wished to obtain information themselves or on behalf of friends or relatives. The final date for being able to apply for an interview was 1 March 2009. One thousand and forty-five people applied and 902 interviews were conducted. However, the accounts of abuse and neglect in the Inquiry’s report are based on 866 interviews. There are several reasons for the smaller number of interviews compared with the number of applicants, including the fact that several interviews were cancelled or that some gave no report of abuse or neglect or did not belong to the target group for other reasons. A more detailed description of the reasons for this is given in Chapter 1.</p>
<h2>Revised opinion on privately placed and Finnish war children.</h2>
<p>In the final report, the Inquiry has revised its assessment of children who were privately placed and the Finnish war children. Its assessment is that, provided that the authorities were aware of a child’s stay in a privately arranged foster home, those children and Finnish war children who were subjected to abuse and neglect should also be included in the various proposals of the Inquiry on Redress for Past Abuse.</p>
<p>Privately placed children</p>
<p>Based on its terms of reference , the Inquiry interpreted the target group as people who were actively placed in institutions by the authorities. This is why people who, on their first contact with the Inquiry, explained that they had been placed on private initiatives, had been excluded. The Inquiry on Redress for Past Abuse is based on a similar definition in its proposal for financial compensation to those affected. This means that privately placed children were excluded, both from the opportunity to be interviewed and in the proposals for financial compensation.</p>
<p>During the course of the Inquiry, it became evident that the distinction between privately placed and authority-placed children may be unclear. One reason for this is that the interviewees themselves did not know whether an authority had placed them in an institution or foster home, or someone else. The Inquiry was unable, before the interview, to check in archive documents whether people had been placed on the initiative of the authorities or not. This means that the Inquiry sometimes interviewed people who, during their childhood, were placed via private initiatives.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s conclusion is that throughout the 20 th  century, no distinction was made between private and formal foster home placements in the legal texts concerning the care of foster children. Up until 1945, the essential difference was instead between placements for which remuneration was paid and placements that, according to available information, did not include any financial transactions. Society had obligations to exercise supervision of foster homes that, in various ways, received payments for caring for foster children, irrespective of whether this money was paid by the authorities (Public Assistance Board or Child Welfare Committee) or by private persons.</p>
<p>Throughout the 20 th  century, the private placement of children in foster homes was a common occurrence in Sweden. This sometimes involved remuneration, sometimes not. Until 1945, children who were placed “ for free” were excluded from society’s protection, and the Child Welfare Committees held no responsibility for exercising supervision of these homes. After 1945, however, the Child Welfare Committees held supervisory responsibility for all children placed in foster homes within the municipality, irrespective of who had placed them there.</p>
<p>During the period in which the 1902 legislation was in force, society’s responsibility differed, depending on whether the child was placed with a close relative (paternal or maternal grandparents) or with people who were entirely unknown. It should be noted that the authorities also sometimes placed children with their paternal or maternal grandparents. Thus formal placements could be made without the child being included in the concept of foster child under the legislation.</p>
<p>The fact that there were children who were placed in foster homes without having been taken into care under any of the legal texts regulating the care of foster children during the 20 th  century does not therefore mean that the authorities had no obligations visà-vis these children. Responsibility for monitoring these children weighed equally heavily on Child Welfare Committees and the social services as for those children whom the authorities actively placed in care. One prerequisite for being able to make demands on the responsibilities of the authorities was, however, that the authorities were aware of where a child had been placed.</p>
<p>Our compilation of information shows that the authorities were often aware of, and also inspected privately placed children and that the number of undetected cases presumably declined with time.</p>
<p>Finnish war children</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s interim report discussed the Finnish war children whom, in large numbers, were received by Swedish families during World War II. From the beginning, there were no explicit rules on the need for social authorities to approve these homes. This culminated in the conclusion that, if the placement of a war child took place after 1944,  the Child Welfare Committee must approve the receiving home. Experience of abuse and neglect in these foster homes as well was thus included in the Inquiry’s remit.</p>
<p>There is, however, reason to revise the image of the authorities’ involvement with regard to the Finnish war children that was presented in the Inquiry’s interim report. After 1944, the Child Welfare Committees in the municipalities were required to approve the placement of Finnish war children in foster homes. The description in the interim report is thus correct in this respect. But even before that, the state was also considerably involved in the issue of the reception and placement of children. This first took the form of state grants and the formation of a state committee, and later by assigning the National Evacuation Committee, the Civil Defence Board, the National Board of Health and the National Board of Health and Welfare with operational responsibility for these activities. Thus the Swedish state was involved in the placement of Finnish war children in a very active manner.</p>
<h2>Inquiries in other countries</h2>
<p>Several countries other than Sweden have held inquiries on abuse and neglect in institutions and foster homes: Norway, Iceland, Denmark, Ireland, the UK (Wales), Australia and Canada. When the interim report was written, Denmark’s investigation had only just begun, and for obvious reasons, had not reported any results. In the Inquiry’s final report, reference is also made to other countries with regard to how things turned out later in life for those interviewed and the significance that the interview had had for the interviewees. There are many similarities in the information that the Inquiry learned, both with regard to people’s experiences of the interview and to how placements affected the adulthood of those interviewed. For more information on the reports of other countries, see Interim report, Chapter 3.</p>
<h2>The Inquiry’s definition of abuse and neglect</h2>
<p>The Inquiry ' s work spans a long period of time, from the 1920s until the 2000s. Certain types of punishment were sanctioned in laws and regulations over different periods of time. The interim report discussed the legislation and instructions regulating punishments, physical violence against, and sexual abuse of children taken into care during the 20 th  century. The reason was to show how long the various punishments and abuse described by those interviewed had been forbidden and classified as criminal offences.</p>
<p>The conclusion was that the abuse and neglect described by the interviewees were often forbidden in laws and regulations.</p>
<p>The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child</p>
<p>The definition of abuse and neglect used by the Inquiry is based on the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. The treatment of an individual child that in any respect differs from the rights prescribed in the Convention has been defined as abuse and neglect by the Inquiry. The rights of the child have been operationalised and classified for each person interviewed. The structure used by the Inquiry distinguishes between two forms of lack of care: abuse and neglect.</p>
<p>Abuse  is divided into physical/emotional abuse and sexual abuse.</p>
<p>The Inquiry was not able to justify a complete distinction between physical abuse and emotional abuse, despite making several attempts in this direction. The reason for this is that all abuse contains elements of emotional violation.</p>
<p>Physical and emotional abuse  are divided into physical violence with a weapon; other physical violence; the harmful use of force; rules and punishments; threats and threatening situations; violations of integrity; victimisation, and injustices.</p>
<p>Sexual abuse  is divided into hands-on abuse, which means touching/penetration of the victim, and hands-off abuse, where the victim was not subjected to direct physical contact.</p>
<p>Neglect  is divided into insufficient care in the foster home/institution; insufficient supervision by the foster parents or institution staff, and deficient schooling.</p>
<h2>Archive documents</h2>
<p>Chapter 3 “ Archive material as a source of the history of institutions and foster homes” discusses the strengths and weaknesses of the archive documents and the Inquiry’s experiences of archive management in Sweden. The importance of archive documents for the individual’s history and redress is discussed. Versions in archive documents and those of the stories of the persons interviewed may both supplement and differ from each other. This is illustrated by case studies. Since the Inquiry interviewed people from all parts of the country, archive documents came from many different municipalities. This provided the Inquiry with insights into how different archive management and processing may have been in various parts of the country.</p>
<p>The chapter is divided into four sections, which give an account of: 1. the general guidelines existing over time with regard to requirements for the contents of child welfare files and social services files, 2. the shortfalls in archive documents to which attention has been drawn in research, 3. the guidelines that have existed for what should be preserved and discarded, 4. some general reflections on the Inquiry’s experiences of requesting access to archive documents and the possibilities for redress that are accommodated in archive documents.</p>
<p>Shortfalls in the archive material</p>
<p>What emerged was that the legislation was generally restrictive in prescribing the information that should be included in a report. However, from the 1960s onwards there were clear instructions from the National Board of Health and Welfare on what should be noted. The conditions for documentation were stipulated in the National Board of Health and Welfare ' s ‘Råd och anvisningar, (1961)’ (Advice and instructions, 1961).</p>
<p>Notes should be extensive and describe the child ' s conditions in the foster home. Where, and in what manner, these detailed notes on the child’s situation in the foster home should be preserved cannot be found in this Advice and instructions.  It would appear to be reasonable for these notes to be placed in the child’s files, but this is not automatic. Both the research community and the Inquiry have shown that many child welfare files did not comply with these instructions and that information was not always found in the child ' s files, but instead could be attached as enclosures in the minutes of the Child Welfare Committee.</p>
<p>Research has also shown that the archive material is deficient in many aspects; the contents of the files often lack an overall structure, uniform concepts and definitions. Thus the contents of the files can vary considerably with regard to their extent and quality.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s experiences</p>
<p>Gaining access to files from different archives can take considerable time. In addition, it can be noted that the management of social services files differs from municipality to municipality. This leads to people seeking their histories in social services files being able to access very varying material. Apart from the fact that, under the Secrecy Act, the classification of documents that the person can access may also vary, files may be missing, or the documentation minimal. As a result of the lack of clarity in the regulations from 1980 regarding the sorting and disposal of archives, the</p>
<p>Inquiry experienced that files had been incorrectly disposed of during this period.</p>
<p>A further problem is that the files may contain insulting assessments or descriptions that are not consistent with the experiences of those interviewed. Sometimes psychological support may be needed in connection with people reading their archive documents.</p>
<h2>Abuse and neglect presented in figures</h2>
<p>The composition of the target group</p>
<p>The final report comprises a total of 866 persons’ stories of neglect and abuse. Five hundred and nine (59 per cent) of these were women and 357 (41 per cent) men. One hundred and fifty-five people, 90 women and 65 men, stated that they belonged to a Swedish minority group or were of foreign origin. Thirteen persons, eight women and five men, stated that they were disabled during their childhoods. The Inquiry interviewed people of a wide range of ages. The oldest were born in the 1920s and the youngest, in the 1980s. The largest group was born during the 1950s, followed by people born during the 1940s.</p>
<p>Two-thirds of the municipalities placed children who were abused and neglected</p>
<p>The 866 people reporting abuse and neglect were placed by a total of 196 different municipalities. This means that two-thirds of the municipalities placed one or more people, who during the Inquiry’s interviews bore witness to the fact that they were exposed to abuse and neglect during the period that they were in institutions and foster homes.</p>
<p>Types of placement</p>
<p>Of the 866 interviewees, 798 were placed in foster homes, 665 in institutions and 213 in other placements. Five hundred and ninetyeight of the 866 interviewees were placed both in foster homes and institutions and 169 persons were placed in all three types of placement. Of the persons interviewed (798) who were placed in foster homes, 96 per cent (763 people) reported abuse and neglect. Almost all of those with experience of foster home placements thus told the Inquiry about abuse and neglect in at least one of the homes in which they were placed. This is not the case for those with experience of placement in an institution, but even here, the figures are high. Of those who were placed in an institution (665), 69 per cent (462 people) reported abuse and neglect.</p>
<p>Small differences in the results compared with the interim report</p>
<p>Now that the results of all the interviews have been summarised, the Inquiry is able to state that there are comparatively small differences in terms of percentage between the interim report, which comprised 404 people’s interviews, and the final report with 866 persons interviewed. Physical violence with a weapon has declined by five percentage points, from 49 to 44 per cent. This can probably be explained by the fact that a larger proportion of younger people were interviewed after the interim report. These reported fewer elements of physical violence in their placements. Harmful exploitation in work  has also declined, from 54 per cent in the interim report to 52 per cent in the final report .</p>
<p>Sexual abuse  shows a slight increase, for women from 61 per cent to 63 per cent and for men from 42 per cent to 43 per cent. Sexual abuse described in the interviews is evenly distributed for all decades.</p>
<p>Neglect  was reported to the same extent as in the interim report. Eighty-seven per cent of those interviewed described how they were exposed to neglect. Reported by their sub-categories, 78 per cent (76 in the interim report) stated that they were given insufficient care.  Twenty-eight per cent (26 in the interim report) referred to insufficient supervision  by their foster parents or institution staff, and 42 per cent (45 in the interim report) referred to insufficient schooling.</p>
<p>The other categories, which are not commented upon here, also deviate very slightly from the results of the interim report.</p>
<p>Physical violence and sexual abuse were common</p>
<p>Only 12 per cent (102 persons) of those interviewed were not exposed to physical violence or sexual abuse. Among these 102 persons who stated that they were not exploited sexually or had been the victims of physical violence were many who experienced other serious abuse or neglect. For example, 57 people stated that they were harmfully exploited in work, 53 people stated that they had experienced various forms of punishment in connection with meals, 50 had to endure people addressing them in a manner that violated their integrity or having to listen to insulting opinions of their close relatives. Forty-nine people were threatened with violence, had witnessed violence or had been frightened by those caring for them. With reference to schooling and health, 29 persons stated that their schooling was insufficient and that they were prevented from going to school or that they did not receive the necessary help with their homework, etc. Twenty-two persons also stated that they had been ill without receiving the necessary care.</p>
<h2>Case descriptions and comparative analyses</h2>
<p>In the final report, the stories of the interviewed people were given particular prominence in the material as a whole. This was done through case descriptions, based on interviews, judgments and records, as well as descriptions of their lives written by the interviewees themselves that are cited in their entirety. What different people stated about the same placement at an institution or foster home is also analysed. The stories of those interviewed were compared with what was stated in the archive material.</p>
<p>Case descriptions</p>
<p>The Inquiry report presents four case descriptions which are primarily based on interviews with the people described. Otherwise, the case descriptions are based on authentic court convictions at district courts or courts of appeal. In addition, there are references to excerpts from records and other archive materials to which the Inquiry had access. These stories aim at giving different examples of circumstances, situations and experiences, based on the account of the interviewee. On the basis of the sum of these accounts, light is thrown on various aspects of the way in which a stay in a foster home or institution was experienced, the reasons behind a placement and the consequences for the affected child. These stories give a concrete form to the vulnerability experienced by the child and point to the importance of adults taking responsibility for the child’s situation. The stories also describe the lack of security surrounding the child when supervision was ineffective.</p>
<p>Life stories provide a deeper insight into experiences</p>
<p>The Inquiry received many written childhood stories. Three of these life stories are included in their entirety in the report. The stories recount memories and experiences, described in the interviewee’s own words. They are individual and unique, but describe events and circumstances that are familiar from other people’s stories, despite the fact that those interviewed were relating memories from many years before.</p>
<p>All of them stated that they were regularly beaten and could therefore not tell how many times this had happened. They selected certain episodes and described them. Others were beaten on single occasions. But the consequences of this were still extensive. They described their continual fear of it happening again, or of the violence they inflicted on themselves in order to adapt themselves to the wishes of adults.</p>
<p>Several personal stories from the same placement</p>
<p>A general description of how different people described their stays at one and the same institution was given in the Inquiry’s interim report. These descriptions are recounted in more detail in the final report. In addition, the presentation was extended to include foster families as well. The aim of the chapter was to focus on, and compare experiences witnessed by several of the people interviewed from the same stay in a foster home or institution.</p>
<p>In total, the Inquiry received stories of abuse and neglect at 119 institutions from at least two people. Abuse and neglect in 35 foster homes were described by at least two people. This means that at least two people separately described abuse and neglect occurring at a placement where they had each stayed. It should be emphasised that the Inquiry obtained these results without seeking out persons who had lived in the same home, as was the case in some of the other investigations abroad.</p>
<p>Foster homes</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s material contains 35 foster families in which at least two interviewed persons were placed, either at the same time or at different points in time. Twenty-seven of these families involved siblings, all of whom were interviewed by the Inquiry. In the other eight families, the stories came from interviewees who were not siblings, but who had experience from the same placement. The majority of these accounts were from placements from the late 1960s until the 1970s.</p>
<p>Largely similar environments were described time after time by people who had experienced abuse and neglect in foster homes: Most of the foster parents had been living in rural areas, several ran farms and kept animals. The foster families had often been a married couple where the mother was at home, and they often had biological children of their own. Another common feature of these homes is that the families had had many foster children, which of course increased the chance for the Inquiry to interview several people who grew up in the same home. Some of the families were described as free-church or active in the Church of Sweden. This was, however, quite a common environment for foster home placements and outwardly the 35 families were probably regarded as secure core families that had an idyllic environment in the country to offer their foster children. The former foster children’s stories, however, give a completely different picture, which also focuses on the importance of questioning an apparently ideal foster home environment.</p>
<p>It can also be noted that the interviewees who had been in the same foster home often gave a similar description of abuse and neglect on a general level, but that the details with regard to neglect or violence may differ.</p>
<p>Institutions</p>
<p>We chose to describe three children’s homes from which the Inquiry documented the greatest number of stories about abuse and neglect. These are Vidkärrs children’s home in Gothenburg, Nybodahemmet in Stockholm och Skärsbo boys’ home in Alingsås. A total of 86 people who lived at Vidkärr were interviewed. Sixty-five of them described abuse and neglect. Sixty-three of the interviewees had been placed at Nyboda. Thirty-one of them described abuse and neglect. It should be added that many came to Nyboda at an early age, and therefore lacked memories of it. Skärsbo boys’ home was a small institution with only around ten places. Nevertheless, as many as 15 people described abuse and neglect there.</p>
<p>Those interviewed often reported the same type of abuse and neglect at institutions, even at a more detailed level, which contributed to a comprehensive picture of what marked out a particular institution at a given period of time.</p>
<h2>Similarities and differences between the accounts of those interviewed and the archive documents</h2>
<p>Using files from institutions and foster homes, the Inquiry report describes what these documents stated about the stays of individual children in society’s care. In this connection, it should be emphasised that the archive documents were created by the same municipalities that were responsible for protecting children from the abuse and neglect that those interviewed described. The Inquiry report also describes how the interviewed persons talked about their periods of placement. Based on this material, similarities and differences in the stories are discussed.</p>
<p>Notes on irregularities are often missing</p>
<p>The archive documents of 128 people were included in this investigation, 41 of whom had some form of note on irregularities in their archive documents. This means that almost 70 per cent lacked any notes on irregularities. There may be several reasons for this. It may be because the entire child welfare file was not sent to the Inquiry, or that it was missing in the municipal archive and the</p>
<p>Inquiry was thus forced to rely on other archive documents that said nothing about the irregularities that the Child Welfare Committee may possibly have known about. However, it is remarkable that seven out of ten of the sample group were not able to verify their abuse and neglect using archive documents. This, in itself, illustrates the difficulty of proving abuse and neglect by using archive documents. On the other hand, applied on the whole group of interviewees, the Inquiry shows that in three cases out of ten it is possible to find some supporting evidence for the stories of abuse and neglect in the archive documents.</p>
<p>Limited possibility of using files to verify or prove false allegations of abuse and neglect</p>
<p>When going through the documents, the Inquiry is able to state that several of the categories of abuse and neglect were nevertheless described in some way in the files: neglect, violations, force and punishments, sexual abuse and harmful exploitation in work. The majority of the 41 interviewees’ archive material confirmed the information they had given on irregularities. However, the extent of the abuse and neglect differed considerably between the stories of those interviewed and the notes in records, since in most cases, there were often only notes on specific abuse or neglect at single placements. An interviewee may have described abuse and neglect at several different places, but if there were notes on neglect or abuse, they were usually only from one placement. Nor was it unusual for the notes to either report a type of abuse or neglect other than that stated by the person interviewed, or to express cautious comments on conditions in the foster home as being “ doubtful .</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s study showed that it was problematic to check the stories of those interviewed against their archive documents. In most cases, it was possible to verify from the files that the persons had been placed in care. In general, the files were entirely consistent with what the interviewees stated with regard to the number of placements, where they had been placed and for how long. However, sometimes the files showed that a person had been placed at more places than the number stated by the interviewee him/herself. Under-reporting on the part of those interviewed compared with the archive material was more usual than overreporting. But the possibility of using the files to verify or prove false claims of abuse or neglect by those interviewed was extremely limited. Checking the stories of those interviewed against the archive documents was also problematic in view of the fact that 70 per cent of the documents included in the Inquiry’s investigation lacked notes on any type of irregularity. This in itself is remarkable and a reminder that it is not possible only to rely on archive documents in themselves being able to verify a claim of abuse and neglect.</p>
<h2>How did the lives of those interviewed turn out?</h2>
<p>The final report continues the account begun in the interim report on what had happened to those interviewed later in their adult lives. The Inquiry report also includes an account of the experiences of other countries’ investigations and states that these are also reflected in the Swedish inquiry.</p>
<p>Limited possibilities</p>
<p>During the interviews, the Inquiry asked open questions on how adult life had turned out for the interviewed persons. The answers involved work, education and family life, but also illnesses, substance abuse, criminality, trust in authorities and, not least, their own self-image. In the opinion of the Inquiry, the abuse and neglect to which those interviewed were subjected when society bore responsibility for them seriously limited their opportunities for a future quality of life. In the material, there is therefore reason to reflect over the fact that so many, despite the abuse, neglect and betrayal to which they were subjected, nevertheless managed their adult lives with varying degrees of success.</p>
<p>Only one or two of those interviewed stated during the interview that the abuse and neglect to which they were subjected had been totally irrelevant for their adult lives.</p>
<p>Great variation in how the abuse and neglect was seen to affect their adult lives</p>
<p>Their stories and own thoughts about what their childhoods – and specifically, their placements in institutions and foster homes – meant for their adult lives, showed great variation. One reason may be that their self-image – the way in which they chose to express themselves, varied considerably among those interviewed.</p>
<p>For some, placement had given rise to a strong will to live, an ability to survive and inner strength. At the same time, others stated that it led to life-long suffering, substance abuse, lack of self-esteem and social exclusion. That physical and sexual abuse inflict deep wounds on a child is obvious and well-known. Less known perhaps is that emotional and mental abuse may be equally destructive. The Inquiry makes no assessment of the extent to which the specific abuse and neglect to which any one individual was subjected was the direct cause of his/her life turning out as it did. What the Inquiry does is to document and describe the individual’s experiences and knowledge about his or her own life and the significance that those interviewed attached to their experiences of abuse and neglect in their childhood. For some of those interviewed, the interview itself was also the first time they had described their deeper feelings about life for an outsider.</p>
<p>Education and work very significant for adult life</p>
<p>To the question on the working lives of those interviewed, just over 400 people stated at the interview that they had worked fulltime throughout their lives. This means that they had either worked and/or studied the equivalent of full time. Three hundred and ninety-six people stated that they had only partially worked and/or studied during adulthood. Twelve people said that they had never worked at all. For the remainder of those interviewed, no information was available. Among those interviewed, their educational level was of crucial importance with regard to how their working lives had been. Many were disappointed at the lost or poorer opportunities for education that they received during their time as foster children or inmates of children ' s homes. One hundred and fifty-nine people, for different reasons, were not able to complete elementary or compulsory school during the years when they would normally have gone to school. In the Inquiry report, 143 people undertook some kind of university or other higher education.</p>
<p>Lifelong suffering</p>
<p>Many described their adult lives as being characterised by poor self esteem and the feeling that they had been socially and psychologically handicapped. Financial problems and physical ill-health were something that many of them believed had dominated their adult lives; several attributed, for example, their continuous and prolonged back-ache to the fact that they were exploited to hard, harmful physical work as children. Criminality, alcohol abuse or, for long periods, the intake of psychopharmacological drugs had also, for many people, characterised their adult lives.</p>
<p>Several stated that, as adults, they had never dared or wanted to start a family, and that this was due to their having been harmed during their childhood. Lost, or poorer contacts with their biological families were, for many, a great loss during their adult lives. Social exclusion, prostitution and even homelessness were described by others, as was the feeling of many that their daily lives were hindered by continuous panic feelings or phobias. Within the wider concept of mental ill-health, other interviewees described depressions, anxiety and periods during which they had been hospitalised for psychiatric treatment. Of those we interviewed, 30 per cent stated that they had periods during which they had contemplated suicide. Nineteen per cent had also attempted suicide one or more times, either during the period of placement, when they were growing up, or later in life. Several also described how they had been ‘emotionally exhausted’ or become ‘ burned out’.</p>
<h2>The significance of the interview</h2>
<p>The significance of the interview for the person interviewed is discussed in Chapter 8. In it, the results of a questionnaire drawn up by the Inquiry are described and comparisons are made with applicable results from investigations abroad.</p>
<p>The majority positive to the interview</p>
<p>The Inquiry sent an evaluation questionnaire to 874 of the 902 people interviewed. Six hundred and fifty-two people answered the questionnaire. It showed that 93 per cent had a positive experience of being interviewed by the Inquiry. Those interviewed stated that it had been important to be able to tell their stories and be listened to, and that it had sometimes meant that they had been able to conclude this episode in their lives, and had experienced it as an opportunity to go forward in life.</p>
<p>Many also described how difficult it was to be interviewed and talk about their painful memories. Several expressed the importance of being able to help prevent it happening again, and emphasised the necessity of exposing the truth about the situation of children in institutions and foster homes. Some of them expressed the wish for redress in terms of society accepting responsibility. The questionnaire also dealt with the way in which those interviewed had experienced the value of the counselling support they had been offered. Thirty-six per cent had made use of this counselling. Of these, 77 per cent considered that they had been helped in some way. Among those who did not use the counselling, it was stated, for example, that they did not feel confidence in the therapist and many also felt that they did not have the energy to talk about their feelings again to a new person.</p>
<p>Sense of redress</p>
<p>Several of those interviewed bore witness to the importance to them of the way in which they had been treated during the interview. The interviewers seemed to be competent and well-prepared for their task. People felt that they were believed. Many also maintained how important it was to them that the Government was aware of what they had been exposed to. They felt that this outweighed the pain and suffering it had meant for them, perhaps for the first time, to describe what they had experienced as children and young people.</p>
<h2>Greater security in institutions and foster homes</h2>
<p>In Chapter 9, a number of themes (circumstances) are summarised that may have been significant in causing the children harm. Examples of such circumstances involve, for example, the lack of investigation, follow-up and supervision, lonely and abandoned children who were never visited by anyone and children with disabilities and deformities. They may have involved closed, isolated environments, placements with influential people or placements with foster parents where there were mental disease or substance abuse. The Inquiry also points to the importance of paying particular attention to radical changes in children’s lives, such as moving house, divorce and death. Finally, there is a discussion of ways in which security for children and young people placed in institutions and foster homes could be improved, based on the experiences acquired though the interviews. The concept of security refers to the efforts of society, primarily municipal follow-up and state supervision, to prevent children and young people from being exposed to various forms of physical, mental and emotional abuse. This means that society takes responsibility for ensuring that children and young people placed in care are able to live and grow up in environments that strengthen their opportunities to develop and that they are given the care and security to which all children and young people are entitled, which includes health care and well-functioning schooling.</p>
<p>Active supervision and follow-up vital</p>
<p>The Abuse and Neglect Inquiry’s experiences all indicate that what primarily determines whether children and young people in today's institutions and foster homes can be protected against abuse and neglect and disadvantaged future development are effective supervision and follow-up. The most obvious means of doing this, to speak to the child him/herself on visits to supervise placements, has proved to be the case far too seldom in the Inquiry ' s interviews. Supervisory staff must also have the skills to be able to talk to children and young people. The child must feel trust, if he or she is to dare to talk about his or her situation. Supervisory staff must have an independent status vis-à-vis the foster home or the staff of an institution. In several of the Inquiry’s interviews, it emerged that the ‘ inspector’ was a friend of the carer, and it was therefore even more difficult for the child to confide in him or her.</p>
<p>A preparedness for the immediate removal of a child to a new placement should also be available. To the question of whether the interviewee would have talked about what they had been exposed to had they known that they would immediately be removed from the placement, the answer was often in the affirmative.</p>
<p>It is time to put what we know into practice</p>
<p>The Inquiry is able to note that today, society’s institutions and foster homes for children and young people are well aware of how care should be designed. Knowledge, many investigations, auditing and supervisory reports are available that have pointed at the risks for children and young people placed in care, as well as knowledge about effective methods of strengthening children’s development. The challenges facing institutions and foster homes today are rather about how this knowledge can be translated into practical action locally.</p>
<p>What makes it possible for children and young people to be exposed to abuse and neglect is a combination of an absence of an individual, personal responsibility in all those who are involved in children taken into care, from politicians to officials at all levels. But also a lack of a genuine insight into the fact that a child or young person taken into care runs a real risk of being exposed to different forms of abuse and neglect.</p>
<p>Responsibility for a more secure system for children and young people in care</p>
<p>The Inquiry considers that the social services committee together with the management of municipalities bears responsibility for continually providing the necessary resources for these activities, for monitoring that there is a high level of skills, and for followingup security for children in institutions and foster homes. The committee is under the obligation to keep itself informed of the work of officials and of the situation of children and young people in the municipality. Apart from talking to management and those responsible for these services in the municipality, the committee must talk to those who work directly with these activities and who meet the children and young people concerned. By doing so, the social services committee can ensure that it regularly obtains up-todate information when it is to take decisions regarding children and young people in care.</p>
<h2>PROPOSALS</h2>
<p>The final report contains few proposals. The Inquiry considers that there is no reason to repeat all the good, already known proposals that previous inquiries have presented. If the Government wishes to improve security for children in institutions and foster homes, there are already many proposals for measures, which do not need to be repeated here.</p>
<h2>The Inquiry’s assessment:</h2>
<p>The Inquiry on Redress for Past Abuse was forbidden in its terms of reference to present proposals on apologies and compensation for those who had been abused and neglected after 1980. No motive was given for this in the Inquiry’s terms of reference. According to the Inquiry’s proposals, those who were abused or neglected after 1980 were to be excluded from the group encompassed by an apology and compensation.</p>
<h2>Proposals of the Inquiry:</h2>
<p>Everyone who has been exposed to abuse and serious neglect, whose cases are statute barred should be included in the various proposals for redress presented by the Inquiry on Redress for Past Abuse.</p>
<p>It would be desirable with: an understanding of a file’s importance to the individual’s right to his or her origins on the part of archive administrators, better knowledge of the files that must be preserved at social services administrations, and a uniform assessment/more even quality when assessing whether a document is secret or not.</p>
<p>This should be possible by: establishing a national helpdesk by the National Archives, in cooperation with suitable city archives, including modules on social services files in archive courses and at courses for social workers, establishing a website containing comprehensive information and assistance, both to administrators and previously placed persons, similar to that existing in Australia.</p>
<h2>The Inquiry’s proposal:</h2>
<p>The Government should assign the National Archives with the task of establishing a national helpdesk to support archive administrators in municipalities and people who have been placed in care by those responsible for institutions and foster homes.</p>
<p>When taking a child into care, society enters the arena as a ‘parent’. For ethical and moral reasons, the municipalities should give priority to following up how the child’s stay in a foster home or institution is developing. Talks should always be held with children, but it is the child who determines him/herself which questions he or she wishes to answer.</p>
<p>Lex Sarah’s extension to apply to institutions and foster homes means that the National Board of Health and Welfare can monitor developments and compile periodic reports on serious irregularities.</p>
<p>In its supervision of the municipalities, the National Board of Health and Welfare should particularly examine whether they have a quality system for following up children’s and young people’s placement in foster-homes and homes for care or residence and the way in which follow-up is conducted in the municipalities.</p>
<p>The National Board of Health and Welfare should also present annual reports to the Government showing how Lex Sarah has been applied with regard to children and young people in institutions and foster homes.</p>
