<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>In order to implement the “Visiting Researcher Directive”, a partially new procedure is proposed for third-country nationals requesting admission for the purpose of conducting research.</p>
<p>As a first stage in this procedure, any public or private organisation that wishes to host a visiting researcher for more than three months must be approved by a competent authority (accreditation). The proposal calls for the Swedish Agency for Innovation Systems (Vinnova) to be the authority for managing the accreditation procedure. Accreditation decisions taken by Vinnova should be subject to appeal in an administrative court.</p>
<p>An accredited research organisation can thereafter enter into a hosting agreement with the visiting researcher. The conditions of the hosting agreement must be reviewed by the research organisation before the agreement is finalised.</p>
<p>The hosting agreement, together with certain supplementary information provided by the visiting researcher, will form the basis for his or her application for entry and residence in Sweden. This application will be examined by the Swedish Migration Board. If the application is granted, the researcher will be issued a residence permit. The residence permit will allow the holder the right to enter, reside and carry out the research project specified in the hosting agreement.</p>
<p>In general, the conditions for granting residence permits to researchers are the same as those that currently apply for visiting researchers. It is, however, not possible to uphold the requirement concerning pre-arranged accommodations. Instead, it should be clear from the hosting agreement that visiting researchers can manage their living costs and return home. The inquiry also proposes that the hosting agreement must demonstrate that the visiting researcher has health insurance coverage during his or her stay here. The conditions to qualify as a visiting researcher will be</p>
<p>met if he or she holds an appropriate higher education, which gives access to doctoral programmes. The provisions on accreditation and hosting agreements are not to be applied to residence permits granted before the provisions enter into force.</p>
<p>A hosting agreement is not required in cases where a researcher stays in the country for less than three months. To ensure that visiting researchers have the opportunity to travel within the EU to carry out research projects, it is proposed that visiting researchers who have been granted a residence permit for researchers in another EU country, as well as their family members, are to be allowed to apply for and be granted a residence permit, even when they are in the country.</p>
<p>If an already accompanying family member is granted a residence permit, it is normally to apply for the same time period as the visiting researcher’s residence permit.</p>
<p>The provisions of the “Visiting Researcher Directive” concerning equal treatment also motivate proposals that visiting researchers and their family members should be on equal footing with Swedish citizens in certain respects. The proposals refer to sickness benefit or activity compensation in the form of guaranteed compensation, and the right to study assistance in the form of student grants or supplementary support.</p>
<p>The proposed amendments should enter into force no later than 12 October 2007. The amendments are not expected to bring about the need for additional government allocations.</p>
