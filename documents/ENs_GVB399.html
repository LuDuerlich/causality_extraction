<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>In Sweden, price adjustment of electricity network operations, and previously also the electricity price, was carried out by means of checking in arrears. In conjunction with the deregulation of the electricity market on 1 January 1996, the Swedish tradition of free pricing was retained, whereby the electricity network companies set their tariffs on the basis of certain general guidelines. The tariffs are thus not determined by the supervisory authority in advance; the authority is first given the opportunity to review whether these are reasonable after the event.</p>
<p>In June 2003, the European Parliament and the Council adopted the Directive 2003/54/EC concerning common rules for the internal market in electricity and repealing Directive 96/92/EC. The overall objective of the new so-called Electricity Market Directive is to create a functioning inner market for electricity in which there is competition on equal terms. The directive contains extensive and detailed regulations that aim at helping to achieve this objective. As far as network tariffs are concerned, it is stipulated in the directive that it is the supervisory authority that is to be responsible in advance  for establishing the conditions for connection and access to national networks, which includes transmission and connection tariffs. The supervisory authority may also choose only to determine or approve those methods that are used to calculate or decide on these conditions. The Electricity Market Directive has in principle been implemented by the proposals for changes and additions to the Electricity Act that were advanced in the Bill entitled Implementation of the EU Directive on common rules for the inner markets for electricity and natural gas, etc.  (Bill. 2004/05:62). In the bill, the Government stated that the method for transmission tariffs should be structured so that it supplements the regulations on tariff design that already exists in the current Electricity Act. Since there was a lack of basic data on which to be able to take a stance on this matter, the Government felt that for an interim period a regulation should be introduced in which the method for tariff setting should be specified directly in the legislation. The Government stated in the bill that it intended to investigate the matter and come back to Parliament with a proposal. It is against this background that the Energy Network Commission has been set up.</p>
<p>The Energy Network Commission has thus been tasked with submitting proposals for the provisions that are needed in order to introduce a new regulation in which the supervisory authority approves or adopts the network companies’ transmission and connection charges before they are allowed to apply. It has also been the task of the Commission to submit proposals on how the foreign connections that are coupled to the Swedish regional network can be managed so that they are dealt with on the same terms as the foreign connections to the National Grid. In this report, proposals are given in both these parts.</p>
<p>Following an introduction in which the preconditions for the Commission work and the performance of the work are described (Chapter 1), a brief account is given of the regulations that currently apply in Sweden (Chapter 2) as well as in Finland, Norway and Denmark (Chapter 3). The proposal part of the report comprises Chapters 4–8. In the following section, a presentation is given of the most important proposals in these chapters.</p>
<h2>Introduction of an advance review (Chapter 4)</h2>
<p>In this chapter, the Commission recommends the introduction of an advance review of network company revenue in such a way that the Energy Markets Inspectorate can in advance determine the overall revenue that each network company is allowed to take from network operations through network tariffs and other charges during a so-called supervisory period. The supervisory period shall be four calendar years. The decision of the Inspectorate is referred to as a ratification decision and shall be communicated before the beginning of the supervisory period. One of the main advantages of an advance review is that predictability is created for both customers and companies regarding the size of the revenue frame. Network companies in this way know how large a revenue they can charge the customers in the form of network tariffs during the coming supervisory period, always provided that the assumptions and preconditions serving as a basis for the adoption of the revenue frame are met. As far as the network companies are concerned, this is very important for the planning of new investments. For the customers, an indirect predictability is created through the tariffs which network companies, following adoption of the size of the revenue frame, adopt in their turn and apply in relation to their customers. Consumer interests are protected in the first instance by the capacity of the regulation to make demands on network companies to transmit electricity of a reasonable quality and in a stable manner, effectively and at a low cost, over the course of time. Furthermore, consumer interests are protected through the supervision of the network companies that is performed by the network authority.</p>
<p>In order for the advance review to lead to the predictability that is required, it is essential that the regulations and decisions of the Inspectorate provide clear frameworks for how assessment of the income frame is made. The Commission proposes, therefore, that the regulations on the reasonability assessment of network company revenues, and the general principles for how this assessment shall be made, should be clarified as a consequence of the change to an advance review of the network tariffs. In the ratification decision, it shall be made clear which information and methods the Inspectorate has applied in the determination of the frame and the sum that the revenue frame amounts to.</p>
<p>It is impossible in advance to determine exactly the sum that the network companies’ revenue is allowed to amount to during the period in question. This is among other things because certain factors are unknown before the supervisory period comes to an end. This may, for example, concern costs for investments, network losses and overlying networks. The Commission proposes, therefore, that the Energy Markets Inspectorate, at the end of the supervisory period, should determine in a reconciliation decision the final applicable revenue frame for the period. The reconciliation decision could therefore result in the revenue frame for the latest supervisory period being raised or lowered in relation to the ratification decision.</p>
<p>During the course of the supervisory period, the total revenue of the network companies shall be reasonable. It is thus possible during parts of the period to introduce higher charges provided that this is compensated by lower charges during other parts of the period. The possibility should, however, be used with caution by the network companies, bearing in mind the interest of the customers in maintaining stable fees.</p>
<p>In certain cases, situations may occur in which a change of the ratification decision is necessary, not least because the supervisory period extends over four years. The Commission proposes first of all that an established revenue frame shall be able to be changed following an application from a network company. A precondition for a change in the revenue frame in this case is that the circumstances which are referred to in the application can significantly change the size of the revenue frame or that there is otherwise some special reason. An example of when a change in the revenue frame can be made is when a company has brought forward major investments in the network, which could not have been foreseen at the beginning of the supervisory period. The Energy Markets Inspectorate shall process this type of application expediently. The Commission also proposes that an adopted revenue frame should be able to be changed by the Inspectorate if, for example, the network company that the decision concerns has submitted incorrect or erroneous information or if the decision has been made on clearly incorrect or incomplete basic data. A ratification decision may also need to be changed when a ratification or reconciliation decision for the network company from a previous supervisory period has been changed following a re-review decision by the Inspectorate or by a court of law. A ratification decision can also be changed following a change in another network company’s ratification decision. This is the case when the change concerns a parameter that is also generally applicable for other companies, for example the percentage of acceptable return for the network company.</p>
<h2>Regulations surrounding the advance review of network company revenue (Chapter 5)</h2>
<p>In this chapter, a presentation is given of the Commission’s detailed proposals on how the regulations concerning advance review of network company revenue should be structured. The Commission’s proposals are given below section for section in the order in which they are presented in the chapter.</p>
<p>Some general starting points in a transition to a purely advance review (Section 5.2)</p>
<p>The Commission concludes initially in this chapter that the term network tariff is used in the current Electricity Act Chapter 4 with two different meanings. Firstly, the term is used in connection with the reasonability assessment of the network companies’ revenue, and secondly in connection with regulations on how a customer-specific network tariff should be designed. The Commission proposes that the provisions of the Electricity Act in these parts differ in that they are placed in two different chapters. It is proposed that the present Chapter 4 of the Electricity Act should be changed so that it only contains regulations on how the network companies shall structure their network tariffs, i.e. with regard to their customers. It is proposed that the regulations on the reasonability assessment of network company revenues should be moved to a new Chapter 5.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Commission proposes that the present introductory regulation in Chapter 4 of the Electricity Act, which determines the main principle that network tariffs shall be designed so that the overall revenue of the network companies is reasonable in relation to the objective and subjective preconditions for running network operations should be removed and replaced by new regulations which instead specify in more detail the content of these concepts. The purpose of this is to create a set of regulations which in a better way than at present clarifies how the reasonability in a network company’s revenue shall be assessed.</p>
<p>Reasonability assessment of network company revenues (Section 5.3)</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>In this section, the Commission gives its proposal on the overall principles for how a new model for the reasonability assessment of network company revenues should appear. In order to achieve greater efficiency and transparency in the future review model, the Commission also conducts a discussion on how the principles and guidelines for the future regulation should appear when it comes to the closer detailing of advance review in, for example, the Inspectorate’s regulations or guidelines and decisions.</p>
<p>As proposed in Chapter 4, prior to a new supervisory period the Energy Markets Inspectorate shall begin determining the overall revenues that each network company can take in through network tariffs during the coming supervisory period (revenue frame). The revenue frame shall be calculated so that it covers reasonable costs for running the network operations and gives a reasonable return on the capital that is needed in order to run the operations (capital base). The basic starting point in the calculation of network companies capital bases shall be the companies’ existing electricity networks, for example in the form of cables, transformer stations, etc. and other assets that are used in network operations.</p>
<p>Calculation of age-adjusted present acquisition value</p>
<p>The valuation of network companies’ electricity networks prior to the first supervisory period shall take place on the basis of a socalled age-related present acquisition value. The present acquisition value for the electricity network shall according to the principal ruling be calculated with the aid of standard costs. The term standard costs is understood to mean the average cost of investing in similar assets under similar objective conditions. If there are special reasons, however, the investment may exceed the standard costs, for instance in the case of investments in metropolitan and archipelago environments where the costs clearly exceed the standard costs. After this, an age deduction shall be made. The network companies do not today have comprehensive information on the age of the different components in the network. This applies above all to older components. Furthermore, age determination is complicated by the fact that new investments in, for example, a transformer station have been made on an ongoing basis and the question then arises as to what age the station really is. The Commission purposes, therefore, and primarily for administrative reasons, that a lowest level for age determination should be introduced – a so-called capital base floor. In practice, this floor corresponds to an assumption on what the average age, or remaining lifetime, of the electricity network amounts to. If a network company has an electricity network that is older than the assumed average age, no information on the age of the network needs to be submitted. There is very limited information available on how old the electricity networks in Sweden are, and it is thus difficult for the Commission to assess with any great precision the average age of the networks. However, the Commission has considered it suitable to set the capital base floor at 50 per cent of the present acquisition value.</p>
<p>If a network company judges that its electricity network is younger that the assumed average age, it is possible for the company to submit information to the Inspectorate which shows this to be the case. This means that the company has to make an age inventory of its entire network. In this inventory the network should be divided up into suitable types of components. The Commission proposes that a floor should also be introduced at component level, a so-called component floor. This floor shall be applied when a network company wishes to show that their network is younger than the capital base floor. But when for a certain type of component it is not possible to arrive at an average age, the Commission feels that an age deduction in these cases shall be made with 80 per cent of the present acquisition value for those components whose age cannot be determined.</p>
<p>The model described above for an initial valuation concerns the electricity network. As far as other property is concerned, such as IT systems, cars, etc., the Commission proposes that it should normally be possible for the book value to be applied as a valuation method. If special reasons exist, it should be possible for the valuation to be made in some other way.</p>
<p>Development of the capital base over time</p>
<p>The valuation of the capital base described above will only be made before the first supervisory period. Subsequently, the Commission proposes that investments be made on an ongoing basis to the capital base and depreciation deducted. In practice, this will be done by the network company, prior to a new supervisory period, registering those investments it intends to make during the period. The principal ruling in the Commission’s proposal is that the investments shall be calculated on the basis of standard costs. However, if there are special reasons, the investment shall be permitted to exceed these costs. This could be the case, for example, in connection with bad weather or accidents when major efforts are necessary in order rapidly to repair and replace damaged installations or for investments in metropolitan and archipelago environments, where the costs may clearly exceed the standard costs.</p>
<p>According to the Commission’s proposal, it is in principle the network companies themselves who will have to determine what investments should be made and which equipment should be used. If an investment is clearly unnecessary in order to maintain a secure, reliable and effective cable network, it should, however, be possible for the Energy Network Inspectorate to decide that the investment shall not be wholly or partially added to the capital base. An important exception to the principle that the investments should be calculated according to standard costs is that the Government or, with the Government’s authorisation, the Inspectorate should be entitled to issue regulations to the effect that investments up to a certain level may exceed the standard costs. The reason for this proposal is that the network company, at least to start with, shall have the opportunity to make so-called reinvestments without the Inspectorate needing to go in and scrutinise the costs for each individual investment.</p>
<p>The Commission proposes that investments should refer to both general investments out in the network as well as to customer-specific network connections. Consequently, costs for network connections according to the main principle shall also be calculated with the aid of standard costs.</p>
<p>The Commission proposes that the Energy Markets Inspectorate should be authorised to issue regulations on methods for how depreciation is to be calculated. This may, for example, concern depreciation periods and choice of methods for capital cost calculation. The Commission feels – in view of the choice of an age-adjusted present acquisition value – that is natural to use a nominal linear method. In addition, a model of this type is relatively simple to apply and understand. However, the fact cannot be ignored that another model at a later stage could be considered more suitable.</p>
<p>Reasonable return</p>
<p>The Commission proposes that a network company should be entitled to a reasonable return on the capital base set by the Energy Markets Inspectorate. The return shall be calculated on the basis of accepted economic methods. The Commission feels that the method which is today used by the Energy Markets Inspectorate, the so-called WACC method, should continue to be used in the new model in order to calculate a reasonable return. However, the Commission’s proposal does not prevent the Inspectorate from applying another accepted economic method.</p>
<p>Current expenses during the supervisory period</p>
<p>As specified above, the Commission proposes that the revenue frame should be calculated so that it covers reasonable costs for conducting network operations. Reasonable costs for conducting network operations shall be considered to be costs for a purposeoriented and effective operation of a network activity with similar objective preconditions.</p>
<p>The type of costs that the network companies can influence should be included in the establishment of the revenue frame after any efficiency adjustments have been made by the Energy Markets Inspectorate. The Commission proposes that the Energy Markets Inspectorate should work out and apply one or more efficiency models or cost standards with the aim of promoting the efficient running of network operations. The type of costs that the network companies cannot influence should be accepted in their entirety. In the opinion of the Commission, the real costs for network losses should – at least to start with – also be accepted in their entirety even if the volume of losses, at least in the longer term, can be partly influenced. The Commission proposes that costs for power outage compensation should not be included in the calculation of revenue frames.</p>
<p>Revenue during the supervisory period</p>
<p>Those revenues that should be included and checked against the revenue frame should be the revenues that the network company has earned on network operations during the supervisory period. If there is a large and perhaps unexpected connection that generates a major one-off revenue for the network company, it could lead to the established revenue frame being exceeded. For the network company it is then a matter of balancing this one-off revenue against somewhat lower transmission fees so that the company’s real revenue remains in total within the revenue frame. In order to avoid unnecessary variations in the transmission fees, the Commission proposes that the network companies should be given the chance to apply to the Energy Markets Inspectorate for the real income from connection charges and for relocating existing networks to be distributed over a longer period of time. An application of this type shall be granted provided the revenues from connection and relocation during the supervisory period have been significant in relation to the revenues from connections/relocations that the network company has normally had from the area in question.</p>
<p>Adjustment of the return with respect to quality</p>
<p>The Commission proposes that the quality of the network companies, with respect to their way of conducting network operations, shall influence the size of the revenue frame in an upward or downward direction. It is proposed that the Government or, subject to Government authorisation, the Energy Markets Inspectorate should issue regulations on what is considered to be quality as regards the way in which the network companies conduct their network operations. The Commission has judged that the Inspectorate, in an initial phase, should develop a model in which the number of power outages and their length should have an impact on the revenue frame. In the long term, however, the voltage quality and other quality variables should also have an impact on the size of the revenue frame.</p>
<p>The evaluation of quality should be based on what the customer should be entitled to expect and is prepared to pay for. It is in this context important to aim for a socio-economically optimum level. This means the quality that the customers are looking for optimally in relation to the price they are willing to pay.</p>
<p>According to the present regulations, the network companies shall pay a so-called outage compensation to customers in connection with a power outage that lasts more than 12 hours. The main purpose of these regulations, which came into force on 1 January 2006, is to create economic driving forces for the network companies to improve the power outage situation so that long-term disruptions become increasingly rare. The Commission proposes no changes in these regulations. In order to make sure that the network companies do not suffer a double economic sanction as a consequence of the longer outages, the Commission feels that they should in such case be kept outside the other quality regulation. Otherwise these outages will have an impact on the revenue of the network companies in two ways; on the one hand as a result of the quality regulation being impaired, which leads to a lowering of the revenue frame, and on the other by a cost being incurred in the form of paid outage compensation, a cost for which the network company is not covered through the revenue frame. Since outage compensation is today included as a cost in the network benefit model, the Commission’s proposal that compensation should not be included in the revenue frame will mean a greater risk for the network companies. The Commission proposes, therefore, that a special overview be made with the aim of co-ordinating the regulations for quality regulation and outage compensation in the best possible way.</p>
<p>The Commission proposes that it should be the duty of the Energy Markets Inspectorate to develop a more detailed model for how the quality regulation is to be structured.</p>
<p>Special aspects regarding connection fees as regards the relationship between network company and customer (Section 5.4)</p>
<p>Through the Commission’s previous proposal that the Energy Markets Inspectorate shall in a ratification decision determine a revenue frame, the network companies will receive notice as to how large a revenue they are allowed to earn from the customers in the form of network tariffs and other charges during the coming supervisory period. Included in the revenue frame are the costs incurred by the network companies for connections.</p>
<p>In this section, the Commission takes a stand on the question of how the customer-specific connection fees are to be structured, i.e. the connection fees which the network company invoices a customer. The Commission proposes that the connection fees on the outtake side up to and including a fuse rating of 63 ampere shall be designed so that the fee corresponds to the average cost in the country for making a similar connection under similar objective circumstances. This fee shall include costs for equipment and work that is normally involved in this type of connection. The proposal thus means a standard method for designing connection fees on the outtake side up to and including 63 ampere.</p>
<p>In the case of other connections, the Commission proposes that the main principle, as today, should be that the connection fee should be structured so that the reasonable costs of the network companies for connection are covered. In this context, special consideration shall be given to where the cable or installation that is to be connected is situated, the power at the connection point and the reinforcements in the electricity network that the connection requires. The Commission also proposes that the principle of sharing shall also be expressed in the legal text. This means that the network company, in the design of the connection fee, shall also consider whether the reinforcement will benefit anyone other that the customer to be connected or whether it can be expected to be of benefit to future connection customers within ten years from the date of the connection.</p>
<p>Repayment of excessively charged fees (Section 5.5)</p>
<p>Those revenues that a network company has received from its customers through network tariffs during a supervisory period will never correspond exactly to the adjusted revenue frame that the Energy Markets Inspectorate sets in its reconciliation decision. Regulations are therefore needed regarding what will happen if the revenues have exceeded or fallen below the revenue frame.</p>
<p>The Commission proposes that the amount by which the revenues have exceeded or fallen below the revenue frame shall lower and raise, respectively, the revenue frame for the subsequent supervisory period. Consequently, no repayment will be made directly to the customer according to the principal ruling. The main aim of this proposal is that the method should be administratively simple. In the opinion of the Commission, however, a method like this can only be defended when an excess billing is not too high. The Commission thus proposes that an excess billing amount shall be charged if the revenues have exceeded the revenue frame by more than 5 per cent. This amount too shall be rolled on to the next supervisory period. However, in two cases an excess billing shall be paid back directly to the customer. This shall be done if the revenues have exceeded the revenue frame by more than 10 per cent or by more than 5 per cent during two consecutive supervisory periods. The repayment shall as far as possible be made to those who were customers during the most recent period and be distributed in proportion to how large the fees were that were paid by these customers for the transmission of electricity during this period.</p>
<p>Transfer of network concession, etc. (Section 5.6)</p>
<p>Chapter 2, § 16 of the Electricity Act stipulates that a network concession can be transferred. One question that arises is what should happen with the adopted revenue frame in a transfer of this type. In the opinion of the Commission it is natural that the starting point should be that the revenue frame accompanies the transfer. The reason for this is that the transfer in itself should not affect the fees the customers have to pay for the transmission of electricity.</p>
<p>Two different transfer situations can be envisaged. In the first, a company can acquire a network concession that constitutes a separate accounting area. The Commission proposes that the acquired company should in this case take over the revenue frame of the entire sold network concession, including the excess or shortfall in billing of the previous period. In the second situation, a company can only acquire part of an accounting area, for example where the Inspectorate has previously decided on the joint accounting of two area concessions. According to the Commission proposal, the principal ruling in a case like this should be that the revenue frame as well as the previous period’s excess or shortfall in billing should be divided proportionally in relation to how large a part of the accounting unit’s capital base has been transferred. However, if there are special reasons, it shall be possible to deviate from this type of division.</p>
<p>The Commission proposes that similar regulations shall apply with respect to decisions on the adjustment of concession limits or integrated accounting.</p>
<p>Energy Markets Inspectorate supervision of network company revenue in practice (Section 5.7)</p>
<p>In this section, a more detailed description is given of how the supervision can be carried out by the Energy Markets Inspection as well as the assessments that can be made in ratification and reconciliation decisions. The Commission proposes that the Inspectorate should follow up on an annual basis how the revenues of the network companies compare in relation to the established revenue frames. The information that the Inspectorate subsequently gives to the companies is not a formal decision and thus has no special legal effect.</p>
<p>Dispute on transmission fees between network company and customer (Section 5.8)</p>
<p>This section takes up the question of how disputes between network companies and customers are to be solved when it comes to the transmission fees to be paid by individual customers. The background to this question is that according to the present regulations it is possible as a customer, after the customary application for a summons, to have one’s network tariff tried by a general court of law. This could lead to complications if a civil court were, for example, to find that a transmission fee was unreasonable at the same time as the Energy Markets Inspectorate and the administrative courts have tried the question of the reasonableness of the network companies’ revenues. The Commission, however, is of the opinion that the present regulations in this respect should not be changed.</p>
<p>Appeals against Energy Markets Inspectorate decisions, etc. (Section 5.9)</p>
<p>In the first part of the section, the Commission gives an account of how the present court hierarchy is structured. A decision made by the Energy Markets Inspectorate can at most be appealed against in three court instances. This means that it will take many years before a decision of the Inspectorate comes into effect.</p>
<p>One of the main reasons for changing to a pure advance review is to increase the level of predictability for customers and network companies when it comes to future tariff setting. The Commission is of the opinion that the implementation of proposals for advance review of the reasonableness of network company revenues must be regarded as being somewhat superfluous unless they are accompanied by regulations for a substantially more efficient and shorter appeal process. However, the Commission concludes that it has not been tasked with reviewing the court hierarchy with respect to appeals against network company revenues. The Commission proposes, however, that the regulations on appealing against decisions made by the Energy Markets Inspectorate should be changed so that the court procedures are made more efficient and the processing period is shortened significantly, and that a Commission is appointed as soon as possible in order to review these matters.</p>
<h2>Foreign connections coupled to the regional network (Chapter 6)</h2>
<p>In this chapter, the Commission is of the opinion that there is no reason to introduce special regulations with respect to network tariffs for the coupling of foreign connections to the Swedish electricity network at regional network level.</p>
<h2>Financial and other consequences (Chapter 7)</h2>
<p>The proposals made by the Commission concerning an advance review that is based on the network companies’ existing networks will contribute towards greater predictability for network companies since it will be possible in a simpler way to gain an overview of the effects an investment has on the capital base and thus the company’s capital costs. In the case of the customers, predictability will be created indirectly through the tariffs that the network companies in their turn establish, after determining the size of the revenue frame. This should in turn result in more stable tariffs.</p>
<p>The Commission’s proposal regarding an initial valuation of the electricity network will mean that the electricity networks of certain network companies will be overvalued. The reverse is also possible since valuation takes place on the basis of standard costs. Furthermore, the change in method will in itself have an impact on the network companies’ capital base. Because of this, it is likely that certain network companies compared with the present situation will be able to raise their charges, whereas other companies will be forced to lower them. As far as the risk of excess billing is concerned, in the opinion of the Commission it will be limited and relatively shortlived.</p>
<p>The Commission’s proposal will mean considerably higher costs for the Energy Markets Inspectorate than were required for the work on today’s regulations. The Energy Markets Inspectorate has judged that a further 14 man-years will be needed in order to practise supervision in accordance with the proposed model. In addition to this, there are costs for producing, among other things, necessary technical systems. The Commission judges that the Inspectorate’s cost increase can be financed through higher fees for supervision.</p>
<h2>Coming into force and interim regulations (Chapter 8)</h2>
<p>The Commission proposes in this chapter that the first supervisory period should begin on 1 January 2012. In order for the Energy Markets Inspectorate to have time to prepare and collect the information that is needed for the ratification decision that is to be announced by 31 October 2011, it is proposed that certain regulations should come into force as early as 1 January 2010 and 1 January 2011.</p>
