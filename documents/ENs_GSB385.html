<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Terms of reference</h2>
<p>On 11 March 2002, the European Parliament and Council adopted Directive 2002/14/EC establishing a general framework for informing and consulting employees in the European Community. Our task has been to analyse and report the situation regarding Swedish rules currently in force in relation to the Directive and to present proposals for amendments to legislation and other measures this inquiry may give rise to.</p>
<h2>The Directive</h2>
<p>The background to the adoption of the Directive is that the existing provisions on employee involvement at national and Community level have not always prevented serious decisions affecting employees from being taken and made public without adequate procedures having been implemented beforehand to inform and consult them. There is a need to strengthen the social dialogue and increase mutual trust in undertakings in order to improve anticipation of risk to employment and to make work organisation more flexible.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Directive is to establish a general framework with minimum requirements for the right to information and consultation of employees in undertakings or establishments in the Community. The arrangements for information and consultation are to be appointed and implemented in accordance with national legislation and existing practice for relations between the social partners. They shall be effected in a way that ensures the purpose of the information and consultation.</p>
<p>Member states may choose to apply the Directive to undertakings employing at least 50 employees or establishments employing at least 20 employees. Certain non-profit operations may be exempted from the scope of the Directive, where such regulation already exists in the member state. Exceptions may also be made for crews of vessels plying the high seas.</p>
<p>The Directive contains definitions of the concepts undertaking, establishment, employer, employee, employees’ representatives, information and consultation. Undertakings refer to both private and public undertakings.</p>
<p>Member states must regulate the arrangements for information and consultation in accordance with certain specified principles, without prejudice to any provisions more favourable to employees in force in a member state. Under the Directive, information shall cover the recent and probable development of the undertaking’s or the establishment’s activities and economic situation. Furthermore, information and consultation shall cover the situation, structure and probable development of employment within the undertaking or establishment and any anticipatory measures envisaged, in particular where there is a threat to employment. Information and consultation must further cover decisions likely to lead to substantial changes in work organisation or in contractual relations, including those covered by the transitional Directive and the Directive on collective redundancies. Consultation prior to decisions shall be held in order to try to reach agreement.</p>
<p>Under the Directive, the employer must give information at such time, in such fashion and with such content as are appropriate to enable employees to acquaint themselves with the issue under discussion, study it and, where necessary, prepare for consultation. In accordance with the Directive, consultation is a discussion and the establishment of a dialogue between employees’ representatives and the employer. Consultation shall be arranged ensuring that timing, method and content are appropriate and at the relevant level. It shall be based on the information supplied by the employer and the opinion which the employees’ representatives are entitled to formulate. Employees’ representatives shall obtain a response to their opinion and the reasons for that response</p>
<p>In principle, regardless of the above-mentioned provisions on information and consultation, the social partners may freely and at any time through negotiated agreement define the practical arrangements for informing and consulting employees, if the member state in question so permits.</p>
<p>The Directive includes provisions on professional secrecy and confidential information. In accordance with the conditions and limits laid down by national legislation and practice, member states are enjoined to prescribe that employees’ representatives may not disclose information provided to them in confidence in the legitimate interest of the undertaking and that employers are not obliged to communicate information or undertake consultation when the nature of that information or consultation is such that it would seriously harm the functioning of the undertaking or be prejudicial to it. Employees shall have access to review procedures for cases where the employer requires confidentiality and decides that information is sensitive.</p>
<p>Member states shall ensure that employees’ representatives, when carrying out their functions, enjoy adequate protection. Should employees’ representatives and employers fail to comply with the Directive, adequate procedures shall be available to enable the obligations deriving from the Directive to be enforced. It shall be possible to mete out sanctions that are effective, proportionate and dissuasive.</p>
<p>The Directive shall be implemented not later than 23 March 2005. Member states should adopt the laws and other statutory instruments necessary to comply with the Directive.</p>
<h2>Conclusions of the committee of inquiry</h2>
<p>The area in which information is to be given and consultation take place under the Directive is covered by the area for information and negotiation under the Swedish Co-Determination in the Workplace Act (MBL). The starting-point for the inquiry was to interpret the Directive’s provisions in the light of the Swedish system for information and negotiation. Consideration has thereby been given to the special role of the parties to collective agreements in this system.</p>
<p>The definitions of certain concepts set out in the Directive tally with Swedish concepts in the area. The concept “consultation” corresponds to the concept “negotiation” in Swedish law in the sense of MBL.</p>
<p>Under the Directive, there are certain possibilities to derogate from it. We propose neither the introduction of threshold provisions nor of special provisions into Swedish law for crews on vessels plying the high seas. Such rules would not be compatible with Swedish tradition in this area. We further consider that the possibility to exempt the aim and direction of certain non-profit operations from the scope of MBL is compatible with the Directive.</p>
<p>Regarding the provisions of the Directive on the arrangements for information and consultation, our assessment is that these provisions are fulfilled through MBL as regards those employees’ organisations, in both the private and public sectors, that have entered into collective agreements. Under MBL, employees’ organisations entering into collective agreements have been given far-reaching rights to exercise influence. These employees’ organisations are entitled to receive information and be consulted on all the issues mentioned in the Directive. However, the Directive prescribes that information and consultation procedures shall be available at all undertakings or establishments insofar as member states do not avail themselves of the Directive’s derogation possibilities. In the Swedish system, workplaces whose employees are not members of an employees’ organisation bound by a collective agreement will not in all the cases prescribed by the Directive have an employees’ representative who can receive information and carry on consultation in the sense of the Directive. We therefore recommend an amendment to MBL in order to ensure that information and consultation can be implemented at all Swedish workplaces where there are employees’ organisations.</p>
<p>In our proposal, the employers’ general obligation to keep employees informed under the first sentence of Section 19 of MBL, should be extended to also include employees’ organisations at workplaces that have not entered into collective agreements. A new provision to this effect should be designated Section 19 a of the Act. Under it, employers who are not bound by collective agreements, will be obliged to continuously keep all employees’ organisations concerned informed about the manner in which the business is developing in respect of production and finance and as to the guidelines for personnel policy. Through this provision, employees’ organisations at all workplaces will be given an opportunity to receive information about the issues covered by the Directive. Employees’ organisations may thereafter decide whether</p>
<p>they want to request negotiations under Section 10 of MBL. In this way, all employees’ organisations will be entitled to information and consultation on all the occasions prescribed by the Directive.</p>
<p>Under the Directive, member states may permit the social partners to freely enter into agreement on the arrangements for information and consultation prescribed in the Directive. In these cases, the social partners may diverge from the minimum requirements insofar as they do not negotiate agreements that set aside the basic principles set out in Article 1. The rights which under Swedish law devolve on employees’ organisations entering into collective agreements are optional. This means the social partners may deviate from them through collective agreements. However, the contents of these rights may not be undermined. We judge that the principles for the limits to optionality in Swedish law correspond to the requirements of the Directive.</p>
<p>Only the provisions of MBL aimed at employees’ organisations entering into collective agreements are optional. This system means that the proposed Section 19 a will not be optional.</p>
<p>Under MBL, an employer may request that certain information be classified as confidential. The parties must negotiate the matter. If a solution is not reached, a court of law may settle the dispute. The rules on professional secrecy contained in MBL do not apply to public sector employees. They are subject to the provisions of the Instrument of Government, the Freedom of the Press Act and the Act on Secrecy. We consider that the Swedish rules for both the private and public sector correspond to the provisions of Article 6.1 of the Directive.</p>
<p>An employer has the possibility of totally withholding certain extra sensitive information from employees. The limits in this context have been developed in Swedish law in the travaux préparatoires and in practice. We consider that the opportunity available to employers to withhold information from employees corresponds to the requirements of the Directive.</p>
<p>The possibilities of commencing an action concerning professional secrecy and confidential information which are regulated in MBL and the Act on Secrecy, also correspond to the requirements of the Directive.</p>
<p>Under the Directive, member states are to ensure that employees’ representatives, when carrying out their functions, enjoy adequate protection and guarantees to enable them to perform properly the duties assigned to them. Under the Trade</p>
<p>Union Representatives Act (1974:358), representatives of employees’ organisations that have entered into collective agreements have far-reaching protection. They are entitled to both leave and to retain to a reasonable degree emoluments, including salary, when performing their duties. In addition, they and other employees’ representatives enjoy protection under the right of association in accordance with MBL. Under these provisions it is prohibited to take measures against an employee for purposes of infringing the right of association or with the effect of infringing that right. Furthermore, MBL provides that an employee who is appointed to represent his/her organisation may not be denied leave in connection with negotiations. We consider that for representatives of employees’ organisations bound by collective agreements, Swedish law corresponds to the requirements of the Directive. However, representatives of employees’ organisations that have not entered into collective agreements are only protected by the rules concerning right of association set out in MBL and by the special provision on leave. This protection is less extensive than that provided through the Trade Union Representatives Act. In order to ensure that the requirements of the Directive are fulfilled for these employees’ representatives also, we propose an additional new MBL provision, Section 19 b. In accordance with this provision, an employees’ representative who has been appointed by his/her organisation to receive information under the proposed Section 19 a of MBL may not be refused reasonable leave to receive that information.</p>
<p>Lastly, we conclude that the provisions set out in MBL and the Labour Disputes Act (1974:371) that apply to compensation and proceedings in connection with breaches of MBL, will also apply to the extended right to information and leave proposed in Sections 19 a and b of MBL.</p>
<p>To sum up, we consider that the additions we propose to the rules of the Co-Determination in the Workplace Act do not mean that the foundations of the system – the major importance and responsibility of the organisations upholding collective agreements</p>
<p>– will be disturbed. The increased duty to provide information which we propose can from the employee’s perspective prevent risks to employment and for employers mean a better basis for decisions prior to restructuring.</p>
