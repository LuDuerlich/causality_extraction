<p>The assignment</p>
<p>My assignment consisted of several parts. I was to review the Care of Young Persons Act (1990:52) with a view to improving the child's perspective and the rights of the child. I was also asked to examine the need for legislative or other measures in order to protect children in cases where the parents are unwilling to cooperate with the social services. I was to consider the need for legislative amendments or development projects in the social services in order to reduce the uncertainties for children living in foster homes for long periods. Finally I was to study the relationship between provisions in the Parental Code relating to the rights and duties of the custodian to decide over matters concerning the child's person and provisions about the child's right to express his or her views freely.</p>
<p>A separate section describes how I conducted the assignment. I considered it especially important that as many people as possible with knowledge of these issues – both individuals with hands-on experience and researchers – were given the opportunity to express their opinions. I have also been in contact with the relevant public authorities in the Nordic countries and the UK.</p>
<p>The parents and society are both responsible for ensuring that the child's needs are fulfilled</p>
<p>Our knowledge of child development has grown significantly in the last few decades. Research and practical experience have taught us a great deal about children's development, what they can and cannot do at different ages and how their mental capacity develops. We also know that each child has a unique personality right from birth and that children have skills and actively seek to bond with those around them, not only their mothers and fathers, but also siblings and other key persons.</p>
<p>New knowledge is constantly emerging, and values in our society are also in a constant state of change. This means that the knowledge we have today will, in time, be reappraised. There are no universal theories or truths in child research; the theories are often contradictory and cannot provide the answers to all our questions.</p>
<p>The fact that there are gaps in our knowledge about children does not mean that we should avoid taking a position on children's need. But it does mean that we should be open and able to admit that we as adults do not always know what is best. We must also remember that all children are different. What is good for one child is not always good for another.</p>
<p>Today the number of researchers and practitioners who base their work on what children have to say about the way they perceive their situation is limited. Therefore much of our knowledge is based on what adults who come into regular contact with children have related. If children were instead given the opportunity to express what they want and feel, our knowledge of their needs would change. It is therefore vital that the individual child is given the opportunity to speak and that children's opinions are met with respect. This applies, not least, in the social services.</p>
<p>The Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) focuses on the child's perspective and expresses children's needs as rights. The child's need for, and hence right to, contact with both parents permeates the CRC. At the same time the child is regarded as an independent individual, which means that the concept of the family to some extent takes on a new meaning. The child is not the property of its parents but has an intrinsic value and rights of its own from birth.</p>
<p>Several of the CRC's articles are designed to give special protection in situations where the adult world violates or fails to respect the child in some way. If the child is sexually exploited or neglected by his or her parents, it may be necessary to separate him or her from the family. However, separation may not take place against the parents' will, except if considered necessary for the best interests of the child.</p>
<p>The CRC also points out that the interests of the child and the custodian do not always coincide. When weighing up the interests of the child against the interests of the parents, the child's interests should always come first. This is essential, since we know that some of the worst violations against children take place in the family.</p>
<p>In conducting my assignment I have used the Convention on the Rights of the Child as a starting point in order to strengthen the position of the child both in relations with its own family and in contacts with the social services. I have also taken into account the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental</p>
<p>Freedoms, in particular Article 8 which regulates the individual's – including the child's – right to respect for a private and family life.</p>
<p>The social services are responsible for ensuring that children and young people grow up in good and secure conditions and that those who risk an unfavourable development receive adequate protection.</p>
<p>At the same time I want to stress how important it is that society as a whole takes responsibility for the well-being of our children. Our social welfare policy is one of the most important means of ensuring that children receive adequate support and help.</p>
<p>The rights of the child not sufficiently provided for in the Care of Young Persons Act</p>
<p>The Care of Young Persons Act is a protective law. Criticism has been raised that it focuses more on examining and describing the shortcomings of parents than on analysing what is best for the child. According to the terms of reference for my inquiry, I was to propose amendments with a view to emphasising the protective nature of this law and that the main concern is the best interests of the child.</p>
<p>The emphasis on cooperation in the Social Services Act has led to considerable changes in the sphere of social work. Today most measures can be carried out with the consent of the parties concerned, which is often the best means of ensuring that the child's needs are fulfilled.</p>
<p>Although there are relatively few cases in which coercive measures are taken pursuant to the Care of Young Persons Act, these children and young people are in an extremely vulnerable position, not only because of the nature of their situation, but also because of the failure to reach an agreement on how best to fulfil their needs. It is always difficult to take measures without the consent of the parents or the child, even if they are necessary for the child's well-being.</p>
<p>I propose the incorporation of a sub-section 1a into the Care of Young Persons Act, which sets out that the best interests of the child shall be decisive in all decisions pursuant to the act. I also discuss how to go about determining the best interests of the child. In my opinion this decision should be based on the child's perspective, i.e., what the child has expressed in combination with scientific knowledge and experience.</p>
<p>I also propose that the right of the child to be heard should be set out in a separate subsection 1b. This will ensure the child's right to express his or her views – one of the CRC's most important and prescient messages. Here, I want to underline that special skills and</p>
<p>knowledge are needed in order to listen to children and understand their reactions. It is essential that this knowledge exists not only among staff in the social services but also in nursery schools, schools and courts.</p>
<p>My proposals are based on the CRC, in which the best interests of the child are a primary consideration. The idea of the best interests of the child is based on two principles: the first is the recognition of children's inherent dignity and equal worth as human beings, and the second is that children are vulnerable and should be afforded protection so they can develop fully as human beings.</p>
<p>Abuse can be physical or mental</p>
<p>I propose an amendment of the wording in Section 2 of the Care of Young Persons Act to include both physical and mental abuse, since I believe that the meaning of the word mental abuse needs to be clarified.</p>
<p>Mental abuse is difficult to define. It is not about isolated incidents but about a relationship and attitude which is demoralising and which has a detrimental effect on the child's view of itself. Children in this category include children who are viewed as a burden by their parents, who are repeatedly emotionally rejected, violated, terrorised and whose parents threaten to leave them. This category often includes the children of drink or drug abusers. It also includes children who suffer from what is known as failure to thrive, a serious – and in the worst case – life-threatening form of stunted growth as a result of mental neglect.</p>
<p>Other than this, I have found no cause for further amendments as regards the care of young persons under the Care of Young Persons Act. However, I do highlight the situation of children in families where one or both parents are mentally ill or intellectually handicapped, in order to draw attention to their vulnerability.</p>
<p>Care applications should contain a detailed account of the child's situation and need for care</p>
<p>I propose that applications to place young persons in care pursuant to Section 4 of the Care of Young Persons Act should contain a detailed description of the child's situation and its need for care so that the court has as reliable a basis as possible on which to make its assessment. A detailed account of the child's physical and mental health is just as important as one of his or her situation at school. The account should also incorporate the child's and custodian's views on the need for care and the situation as a whole.</p>
<p>The problems of the social services in highlighting children and their needs in their reports about them have long been known. Efforts to incorporate the children's perspective into more areas of activity are taking place in several municipalities in Sweden, but they still tend to focus too extensively on the parents' needs. Therefore, in the descriptions upon which applications pursuant to the Care of Young Persons Act are based, the child's situation is often dealt with all too sketchily.</p>
<p>I propose that the applications should, as a rule, contain a specified care programme. Today care programmes are not always outlined, which makes it difficult for the child and custodian to take a stand. The proposed amendment aims to make it easier for those concerned, including the courts, to form an opinion about the care proposed by the social welfare committee.</p>
<p>Parents and young people should continue to have the right to consent to care during court proceedings</p>
<p>In my opinion, the right to agree to care during court proceedings should be retained.</p>
<p>The right to consent to care during court proceedings in order to avoid care pursuant to the Care of Young Persons Act has been questioned. It has been suggested that parents and, when appropriate, young persons, who have refused care at an earlier stage should not be able to change their minds in court. In my opinion, they should retain this right.</p>
<p>The advantages of placing children or young people in care with their parents' or their own consent are so great that they outweigh the problems that may arise from having to form an opinion to consent given in court. Doing away with this right would also conflict with</p>
<p>other legislation in which the individual's right to have a say serves as a guiding principle.</p>
<p>The rights of the child must be improved in court proceedings</p>
<p>I propose the incorporation into Section 35 of the Care of Young Persons Act of a provision to the effect that county administrative courts and administrative courts of appeal should, if necessary, be able to hear experts during oral negotiations. Children must be afforded a stronger position in court proceedings if we want to give meaning to the words the best interests of the child and children's right to life and development.</p>
<p>The experts should be given the opportunity to address any questions to the parties concerned that may be relevant to their task. By inviting experts to participate in negotiations the courts will obtain a better basis on which to assess the child's need for help and support.</p>
<p>In my opinion, individuals appointed to represent children in court in accordance with the Care of Young Persons Act should fulfil certain requirements. They should have skills and knowledge relevant to the task, including the ability to communicate with children – even very young children – and to explain in a way that is comprehensible to a child what is happening and why.</p>
<p>My proposal supports the provisions already set out in the Act on Special Representatives for Children (1999:997). The purpose of this act is to strengthen the rights of the child in cases where a custodian or someone close to the custodian is suspected of having committed an offence against the child.</p>
<p>I propose that court decisions pursuant to the Care of Young Persons Act should be enforced immediately, unless otherwise decided by the court. The purpose of amending Section 40 of the Care of Young Persons Act, is to emphasise the protective nature of this act and to ensure that the care of a child is not broken off owing to error or oversight.</p>
<p>Children and young people in public care have the right to high quality care</p>
<p>I propose that both the Social Services Act and the Care of Young Persons Act should specify that the social welfare committee should make regular personal visits to the child's home and conduct one-to-one</p>
<p>conversations with the child. I also set out the considerations I believe to be necessary when monitoring the care of children and young people.</p>
<p>Children and young people in public care have the right to high quality care. One of the social welfare committee's fundamental tasks is therefore to monitor the situation of children in care and to ensure that these children are in good physical and mental health and that they develop according to the best of their ability. At present, however, there are considerable deficiencies in the monitoring of public care for children and young people. In recent decades this has been perceived as one of the greatest problems in the care sector.</p>
<p>Children have the right to a family for life</p>
<p>One of the tasks set out in my terms of reference was to consider the need for legislative amendments or development projects in the social services with a view to reducing the uncertainties for children living in foster homes for long periods. Children who are placed outside their parental homes pursuant to the Social Services Act or the Care of Young Persons Act should, as a rule, be reunited with their parents sooner or later, with an emphasis on sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>Assessment after three years</p>
<p>I propose that, after three years, the social welfare committee should make a special assessment of the arrangements for the child's future. The assessment should cover children in care pursuant to both the Social Services Act and the Care of Young Persons Act. A new Section 13b should be incorporated into the Care of Young Persons Act and a new Section 28a into the Social Services Act. The aim of the assessment would be to ensure that children and young people, to as great an extent as possible, can enjoy continuity in their relationships and have a family for life.</p>
<p>I have found that many of the children who are placed in care before they reach their teens remain in care for more than five years. Some grow up in their foster homes. This has been the situation for decades. We therefore have a situation where the purpose of the legislation does not correspond to reality – a reality where children live in uncertainty about their future. This reflects a lack of respect for the child and is not in tune with the principles of the CRC. It is also objectionable from a legal security perspective.</p>
<p>Custody should be transferred to foster parents in a greater number of cases</p>
<p>I propose an amendment to the Social Services Act and the Care of Young Persons Act to the effect that the social welfare committee should consider whether there is reason to apply for transfer of custody in accordance with Chapter 6 of the Parental Code. In my opinion, social welfare committees should, to a considerably greater extent than today, take the initiative to transfer custody to the child's foster parents if they consider this to be in the best interests of the child. They should be able to do this even without the consent of the custodians.</p>
<p>I also believe that the possibility of adoption should be examined in the case of children who have been placed in care as infants and have formed all their emotional ties with the members of their foster home.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I propose that both the Social Services Act and the Care of Young Persons Act should clarify that the child may remain in the foster home for an unlimited time. If a decision to this effect is taken, it will no longer be necessary to consider whether care should be discontinued. However, the social welfare committee should regularly follow up the child's situation and development.</p>
<p>Children have the right to be regarded as independent individuals in connection with decisions to discontinue care</p>
<p>I propose an amendment to Section 21 of the Care of Young Persons Act which deals with the termination of care, to the effect that a decision of this kind may not conflict with the best interests of the child. This would ensure that the rights of the child under the CRC are reflected in the Care of Young Persons Act. This proposal is consistent with my proposal for the incorporation of a new Section 1a.</p>
<p>When assessing the best interests of the child, the underlying assumption should be that the child will be reunited with its parents. However, it is also important to consider the amount of time the child has been in care outside its parental home, the child's relations with the person(s) in charge of its care, and the nature of the relationship between the child and its custodian. In accordance with my proposal for a new Section 1b, the older the child, the more importance one should attach to the child's wishes.</p>
<p>The consequences of my proposed amendment to Section 21 of the Care of Young Persons Act would be as follows. Care pursuant to the Care of Young Persons Act shall not be terminated if a decision to this</p>
<p>effect conflicts with the best interests of the child – even if the reasons for placing it in care under Section 2 or 3 no longer exist. Thus the assessment should not be dependent on whether the reasons for placing the child in care in the first place still exist. It should be possible to distinguish the child's situation from that of its parents and examine whether it is in the child's best interests to return to its parental home.</p>
<p>Younger children should have the same right to protection as young people</p>
<p>I propose an amendment to Section 22 of the Care of Young Persons Act so that coercive measures to help the child in its home environment may be taken at an earlier stage than today.</p>
<p>Hitherto, the only form of coercive measures with regard to younger children has been to place them in care. In my view, the Care of Young Persons Act is deficient, in that there is no middle course between measures taken with the consent of the parties involved and placing the child in care. This benefits neither the child nor the parents. Neither is it reasonable that young children at risk on account of conditions in their home environment do not have the same right to protection as young people whose health or development is at risk on account of their own behaviour. If other options were available it might be possible to avoid separating children from their parents, which is preferable.</p>
<p>I propose that it should be possible to place children in pre-schools, pre-school classes or after school centres since it has been shown that involvement in such activities benefits children.</p>
<p>The social services should have the right to speak to the child, even against the will of the parents</p>
<p>I propose the incorporation into Section 50a of the Social Services Act of a provision that the social services should have the right to speak to the child even if the parents are opposed this.</p>
<p>During my examination of the relationship between provisions in the Parental Code about the rights and duties of the custodian to decide over matters concerning the child as an individual and provisions about the child's right to express his or her views freely I have found the following.</p>
<p>In certain circumstances it is already possible today to speak to a child against the will of its custodian, for example, if the child is</p>
<p>mature enough that his or her will is decisive. Nevertheless, I feel that a concrete provision is necessary, in order to dispel the current uncertainties among the social services. Moreover the proposed provision goes one step further and also applies to cases in which it is not possible to talk to children against the will of the custodian today. Thus, although the provision implies a restriction of the custodian's right to decide in matters which affect the circumstances of younger children but, should nevertheless be introduced in order to provide greater support and protection.</p>
<p>Young people with psychiatric problems have the right to psychiatric help and support</p>
<p>The terms of reference for my inquiry raise the issue of where to draw the line between care on the basis of the Care of Young Persons Act and the Compulsory Mental Care Act (1991:1128).</p>
<p>I have found that the Care of Young Persons Act should not be extended to comprehend young people with psychiatric problems as well.</p>
<p>Today psychiatric problems do not constitute grounds for intervention on the basis of the Care of Young Persons Act. If a young person cannot be considered to be seriously mentally disturbed under the terms of the Compulsory Mental Care Act, this act cannot be applied. The question has therefore been raised as to whether legislative measures need to be taken in order to give these young people the care they need.</p>
<p>In my opinion the social services would require an entirely different organisation and new skills if the Care of Young Persons Act was to extend to young people with psychiatric problems too. These young people have the right to help and support from the instance qualified to deal with them – the psychiatric care services.</p>
<p>Neither do I see any reason for extending the terms of the Compulsory Mental Care Act. In the Compulsory Mental Care Act the terms for taking coercive measures in custody cases are stricter than in older legislation, which has led to considerable developments in work with mentally disturbed patients.</p>
<p>The problems that have been described are partly about qualitative shortcomings in the psychiatric care services, and partly about the need for further cooperation between the social services and the psychiatric services for children and adolescents. These cannot be solved through the use of increased coercive measures against young people.</p>
<p>Through contracts with the responsible health and care authorities for the years 2002-2004, the Government has set aside funds primarily for use in the medical and health-care services, with a special focus on the psychiatric services.</p>
<p>My hope is that these extra resources will help to ensure that the needs of young people in the grey zone between the social services and the psychiatric services can be better fulfilled in the future, without an increase in the use of coercive measures.</p>
