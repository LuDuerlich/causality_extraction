<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Proposal for new provisions on compensation in the Expropriation Act</h2>
<p>General</p>
<p>In accordance with what is stated in the supplementary terms of reference (ToR 2007:89), the Inquiry has conducted a review of the rules on compensation in the Expropriation Act and taken a position on whether there is reason to amend them.</p>
<p>With regard to the need for a review, our original terms of reference (ToR 2005:147) stated the following.</p>
<p>In recent years, it has been questioned from some quarters whether the principles on which the provisions on compensation in the Expropriation Act are based are appropriate. In this context, it has been claimed that the conditions under which expropriation is undertaken have changed. Despite the use by private actors of the institution of expropriation ever since the rules acquired their current wording at the beginning of the 1970s, the majority of expropriations were at that time undertaken by public actors.</p>
<p>The first part of the Inquiry’s remit, reported in the interim report</p>
<p>How are the provisions on compensation in the Expropriation Act being applied? (SOU 2007:29), primarily contained a survey of how the provisions on compensation in the Expropriation Act are applied in practice. The result of this survey confirmed that since the Expropriation Act came into existence, there has been a shift from the requisitioning party being a public legal entity to it now often being a private legal entity and to there being, in certain cases, profit interests behind the compulsory acquisition even though the original principle of expropriation remains, i.e., that various public interests are satisfied. The survey also showed that voluntary agreements on property transfers and leases without the rules on compulsory acquisition being directly applied are a widespread occurrence and that compensation is generally higher in these cases.</p>
<p>One of the points of departure of our remit is that the protection of private property rights must be strong. Under our terms of reference, we are to take into account the rules on the protection of property in the Instrument of Government and the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms when considering the question of whether application of the rules on compensation in Chapter 4 of the Expropriation Act leads to reasonable results. The right to property is one of the cornerstones of the legal order and is protected both in the Swedish constitution and in international conventions.</p>
<p>Together with the provisions of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, the Instrument of Government contains the fundamental criteria for when it is possible to compulsorily acquire land and rights to land or when restrictions can be forcibly imposed on the use of private land or buildings. These provisions also state the conditions applying with regard to the minimum amount of compensation to be paid when someone is compelled to relinquish his or her property. Unlike the Swedish constitutional provision, the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms contains no explicit rule to the effect that compensation is to be paid in the case of interference in other people’s property. This means that the Swedish constitution is clearer in this respect. National legislation can, however, make the protection given by the Convention more explicit.</p>
<p>We consider that it should be clearly stated that the protection of property in the Instrument of Government is a minimum protection. There is thus nothing to prevent legislation that provides stronger protection for compensation than that prescribed by the Instrument of Government. Basically, however, there is no conflict between the provisions on compensation in the Expropriation Act and the Instrument of Government or the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. This naturally does not preclude it from being considered, nevertheless, reasonable to amend the current provisions on compensation in certain parts.</p>
<p>When undertaking this survey, all the basic provisions on compensation have been examined in the light of the fundamental principle referred to in our terms of reference, namely that the protection of private property rights must be strong. In accordance with what is also stated in the terms of reference, we have thus endeavoured to ensure</p>
<p>• that compensation for compulsory acquisition is established in a manner that is, and is seen to be, legally certain,</p>
<p>• that the new provisions on compensation are simple to understand and apply, and</p>
<p>• that they are designed to lead to predictable results, and thus, like the older rules, to facilitate amicable solutions.</p>
<p>Market value</p>
<p>Our terms of reference state, as a point of departure for our remit, that the compensation determined through a decision by a government agency or court shall in principle correspond to at least the market value of the property acquired or the reduction in the market value of the property, if part of it is acquired.</p>
<p>According to the current provisions of the Expropriation Act, compensation for a property acquired is to be paid to an amount equivalent to the market value of the property. If the expropriation concerns part of a property, compensation is to be paid to an amount equivalent to the reduction in the market value caused by the expropriation. If damage is otherwise caused to the owner, compensation shall also be paid for such damage.</p>
<p>We consider that the market value should continue to be the basic point of departure for how damage is determined in the event of an expropriation or some other form of compulsory acquisition of real property. In addition, just as is the case today, compensation is to be paid for other financial damage caused by the compulsory acquisition.</p>
<p>Individual value and profit sharing</p>
<p>The purpose of expropriation legislation is to prevent a property owner from being able to use his or her monopoly position so as to demand an unreasonably high price when acquisition of land that is desirable from a community viewpoint is undertaken. Provisions on compensation should therefore, as far as possible, emulate a free market, without allowing any such monopoly position and without threats of expropriation. A private property owner would not voluntarily sell his or her property, if the price did not amount to at least the personal value he or she places on his or her property. This value is often higher than the market value. Apart from the compensation to be paid for the market value (or for the reduction in market value) and for possible other financial damage, we therefore propose that compensation should also include compensation for the personal value to the property owner. Since this value cannot be determined objectively, our proposal is for this compensation to be set as a standard supplement amounting to 25 per cent of the market value (or the reduction in market value). When acquiring land for purposes that are primarily operated on market terms, compensation is also to include special compensation related to the purpose, or what is termed ‘profit-sharing’. The additional compensation in such cases is to be determined according to what is reasonable in the individual case, bearing in mind the special value of the property to the party acquiring it.</p>
<p>The presumption rule and the influence rule</p>
<p>Under current law, two exceptions are made from the principle that compensation is to be paid for the market value.</p>
<p>Under what is known as the presumption rule, expectation values shall only be compensated for if they already existed ten years before the expropriation. The changes that have occurred with regard to the housing market, etc, since the introduction of the provision means that several of the original reasons for the presumption rule no longer apply. In cases where the situation has not changed in itself, i.e., primarily in acquisitions paid for out of tax revenues, we consider that the advantages that may be gained by the community in the form of a lower level of compensation are, in some cases, not outweighed by the property owner’s demand for compensation that amounts to at least the market value. We therefore propose that the presumption rule be annulled.</p>
<p>Under what is known as the influence rule, the positive or negative effect that the expropriating company itself has had on the market value is only compensated for when this is considered reasonable, taking into account how common this influence is in the locality or in general. Negative influence is termed ‘company damage’ and in this respect the provisions of the Expropriation Act comply in principle with the provisions on environmental damage in the Environmental Code. Our assessment is that these provisions should not be amended, except that in determining the compensation, no ‘tolerance deduction’ should any longer be paid. This deduction often reduces compensation by as much as 5 per cent of the value of the property. Positive influence is termed ‘company benefit’. We propose that no exceptions be made from the market value principle with regard to benefit. Compensation is thus to be paid for the market value, even if this value more or less depends on influences due to the expropriating company in question.</p>
<p>The burden of proof in expropriation cases</p>
<p>The Expropriation Act contains no particular rule on burden of proof (apart from the presumption rule) with regard to issues concerning compensation. When examining compensation issues in a court of law, the ordinary rules on burden of proof used in tort liability cases are applied. This means that, in cases concerning the issue of determining compensation under the Expropriation Act, the court must put a value on the property within the limits set by the parties, even though the evidence does not provide the court with sufficiently clear information about this value. One prerequisite, however, is that the party entitled to compensation has not avoided producing possible evidence without good reason. If, nevertheless, the property owner has difficulty in producing evidence of damage, it is possible for the court, under Chapter 35, Section 5 of the Code of Judicial Procedure, to estimate the damage at a reasonable amount.</p>
<p>We consider that there is no reason to propose a special rule on evidence for the examination of compensation issues in the context of expropriation which would mean diverging in this particular area from the general principles on examination of evidence.</p>
<h2>The proposal for compensation for costs of surveying proceedings</h2>
<p>In the event of surveys undertaken by a surveying agency, i.e., primarily in surveys undertaken under the Real Property Formation Act, the Joint Facilities Act and the Utility Easements Act, the parties concerned are not at present entitled to compensation for their own costs. Our proposal is that, in certain cases, the surveying agency should be able to order the purchaser to pay some compensation to the parties concerned for their costs for legal counsel and representatives, for their own investigations and for their attendance at survey meetings. It should be possible to order compensation for costs only in cases where the rules on compensation of the Expropriation Act are to be fully applied. Compensation is to cover only the costs that have been necessary to protect the party’s rights during the survey proceedings. This primarily refers to necessary costs for legal counsel and representatives and costs of personally attending meetings, apart from certain cases in which the party is represented by a counsel or representative. Only in exceptional cases is compensation to cover the costs of investigations. If a survey in connection with which compensation for costs may be ordered is appealed against, the same provisions on litigation costs are to apply in the land court as in the case of expropriation.</p>
<h2>Other matters</h2>
<p>Under our terms of reference, we are to take note of whether the amendments to the rules on compensation in the Expropriation Act that we propose should lead to amendments in the statutes referring to these provisions and to propose the necessary amendments.</p>
<p>Our assessment is that in most laws that refer to the rules on compensation in the Expropriation Act, the proposed amendments will apply without amending the law concerned, as these laws refer to Chapter 4 of the Expropriation Act. The special provisions to be found in several laws concerning application of the presumption rule, must, however, be annulled. Certain other regulatory adjustments will also be necessary for consistency.</p>
<p>We propose that the provisions on environmental damage in Chapter 32, Section 1 of the Environmental Code be amended so that they comply with the proposed provisions in the Expropriation Act. The provisions of Chapter 31, Section 6 of the Environmental Code stipulating that compensation, in some cases – such as when nature reserves are established – shall be reduced by the amount that the property owner is normally obliged to accept without compensation, are to be annulled.</p>
<p>Under our terms of reference, we are required to estimate the financial consequences of our proposals for property owners, expropriators, consumers and other involved parties and to illustrate what consequences they may have for investments in various types of infrastructure and industrial operations. Our overall assessment is that the regulatory amendments that we propose will in themselves lead to greater expenses and will therefore result in higher costs, but that the consequences in the form of price increases, budget effects, etc., will nevertheless be moderate.</p>
<p>The Inquiry considers that the earliest possible date for entry into force of these amendments is 1 July 2010. None of these legislative amendments should apply to cases or matters that are already ongoing at the time of entry into force.</p>
