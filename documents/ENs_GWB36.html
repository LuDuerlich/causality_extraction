<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>The present Estate Agents Act entered into force on 1 October 1995. Our remit has been to review the Estate Agents Act and consider the changes and additions that need to be made.</p>
<h2>Purpose of the proposal</h2>
<p>We have endeavoured to present proposals that</p>
<p>• give consumers good protection, adapted to take current conditions into account, in transactions that concern their own housing, and</p>
<p>• give estate agents good conditions for conducting their business</p>
<h2>Proposals</h2>
<p>•  New Act applying solely to dealings with consumers</p>
<p>The present Estate Agents Act will be replaced by a new Estate Agents Act that applies solely to professional estate agency services targeted at or conducted on behalf of consumers. Making the new Act refer solely to dealings with consumers will make it possible to give consumer protection an even more central role than in the present legislation.</p>
<p>•  The estate agent’s impartiality</p>
<p>The prohibition against an estate agent stepping in as buyer of a property that he or she is or has been engaged to act as an agent for will be made absolute. Further, an estate agent will not be allowed to act as agent in a property transaction in which the seller or the</p>
<p>buyer is a natural or legal person with whom he or she has close connections. The estate agent must also decline or withdraw from a business engagement if for some reason he or she has or will acquire a substantial personal or financial interest in the transfer of property that the business involves. Under the new Estate Agents Act, as in the present Act, the estate agent will not be allowed to represent the seller or buyer.</p>
<p>•  The estate agent’s obligations towards the seller, buyer and client will be broadened and clarified</p>
<p>The new Act will contain separate sections specifying in detail the obligations of the estate agent towards the seller, buyer and client respectively. This will make it clearer what obligations the estate agent has towards each party. The estate agent’s obligations will be broadened in that he or she will be obliged to state the property’s estimated market value and inform the buyer in writing of his or her duty to have the property inspected.</p>
<p>•  Records of the business engagement</p>
<p>The new Act will require an estate agent to keep notes on what occurs in each piece of estate agency business in which his or her services have been engaged. The documentation is to contain the information that is required to make it possible later to assess the work performed by the estate agent. The notes are to be delivered to the client and his or her counterpart after the business engagement has been completed.</p>
<p>The purpose of the proposed obligation for the estate agent to state an estimated market value is to give the seller and buyer better information to prepare them for the property transaction. The estate agent is also to inform prospective buyers about the arrangements in the event of a bidding process. Further, the estate agent is to draw up a list of the bids made for the property and deliver the list to the seller and the final buyer after the transfer of ownership. These changes will give prospective buyers a better information base for assessing whether the starting price is realistic. Prospective buyers will also be in a good position to decide whether they wish to take part in a certain bidding process. Further, both seller and buyer will be able afterwards to check that all bids have been conveyed to the seller and that he or she has had an opportunity to take a position on all bids.</p>
<p>•  Secondary services</p>
<p>The present prohibition against an estate agent engaging in activities that are apt to shake confidence in the estate agent will be replaced by an obligation on the part of an estate agent who intends, in return for some form of remuneration, to act as an agent for a loan or insurance policy, for example, to notify the Board of Supervision of Estate Agents of this in advance for registration. The estate agent is to inform the buyer and seller of the registered situation and of the remuneration that the estate agent is receiving. The purpose of registration is to make the estate agent’s secondary services visible.</p>
<p>•  Advance decisions and sanctions</p>
<p>The Board of Supervision of Estate Agents will be able to deliver an advance decision on whether a certain way of proceeding is compatible with sound estate agency practice or whether a certain procedure constitutes trading in property that is not allowed by law. An advance decision gives the Board of Supervision of Estate Agents an opportunity to declare its position on a certain question in advance, while enabling the individual estate agent to obtain the Board’s assessment of a certain procedure before he or she has applied it. Further, the system of sanctions in the Estate Agents Act will be made more differentiated by the introduction of a new sanction, a caution, which is less severe than a warning. A decision to strike an estate agent off the register will in future only apply immediately in cases where this is specially prescribed.</p>
<p>•  Provisions on complaints and statutory limitations</p>
<p>The new Estate Agents Act will contain provisions on complaints and statutory limitations. If a buyer or seller of a property wants to claim damages from the estate agent, he or she must notify the estate agent of this within a reasonable time after he or she has noticed or should have noticed that damage has occurred. However, such notification may not be made later than ten years after the estate agent has completed his or her business engagement.</p>
<p>•  Remuneration of the estate agent</p>
<p>Under the new Estate Agents Act, clients and estate agents will continue to be free to enter into agreements on questions concerning the calculation of remuneration for the services provided by the estate agent. The provisions on remuneration for the services provided by the estate agent will be changed in that the presumption in favour of remuneration in the form of commission will be replaced by a presumption in favour of reasonable compensation for work performed and expenses. The estate agent is to draw up an itemised bill if the client requests this. If the parties have agreed on commission, the estate agent will also be obliged to present to the seller a list of the persons he or she considers he or she has introduced and to whom a transfer of ownership can therefore justify commission even though the business engagement has ended.</p>
<p>•  The title of estate agent</p>
<p>Penal protection will be introduced for the professional title ‘estate agent’. This penal protection will strengthen the position of the estate agent and enable consumers to have greater confidence than is now possible that the person claiming to be an estate agent does in fact meet the requirements made by law for this professional category.</p>
<p>•  Special rules for estate agency involving tenant-owned housing and rental housing</p>
<p>Provisions will be introduced into the Act concerning the estate agent’s special obligation to provide information when acting as an agent for tenant-owned housing and rental housing. With regard to agency involving tenant-owned housing, the estate agent will be required, for example, to make the statutes and annual report of the tenant-owner association available to the buyer.</p>
