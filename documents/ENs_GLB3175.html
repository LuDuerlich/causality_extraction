<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Our basic attitude</h2>
<p>Every individual who seeks or has employment should have the right to be judged on the basis of his personal characteristics and preconditions for carrying out the work. The sexual orientation of a job applicant or employee is a private matter, and it is not possible to draw a conclusion about an individual’s capacity or manner of performing a job on the basis of his or her sexual orientation.</p>
<p>In regards to working life, every individual should also have the right to avoid facing irrelevant, arbitrary or, quite simply, offensive grounds of assessment. Since sexual orientation as a rule lacks relevance in terms of working life, an employer should not, in principle, take sexual orientation into account at all in regard to employees or job applicants. Doing otherwise would be to accept the infringement of an individual’s right to his or her sexual orientation and his or her right to fair and just treatment. Such infringements constitute the type of discrimination that should be forbidden.</p>
<p>In our judgment the openness of society towards homosexuals and bisexuals has increased significantly in the recent past. The suspicions and prejudices have decreased somewhat. Some reasons for this are the public attention that developed due to, among other things, the 1994 Partnership Act  and the fact that it has become more common with openly homosexual and bisexual persons in the mass media. Homosexuality has simply become more visible and to some extent less dramatic.</p>
<p>Nevertheless homosexuals and bisexuals still constitute an exposed group. Our considerations start out from the well-documented idea, in various fields, that many people in Sweden maintain an unsympathetic, reserved or even repudiatory attitude to homosexuals and bisexuals. Also, on the basis of our own research and the contacts we have had during the course of the inquiry we feel that we are able to say that discrimination of homosexuals and bisexuals occurs in working life. In many cases the discrimination is a result of the negative attitudes mentioned.</p>
<p>Something that is clearly common for many homosexuals and bisexuals is that they hide their sexual orientation in regard to, among others, other employees as well as their employers. This ”strategy of concealment” means for example that a distance is maintained in regard to other employees concerning personal matters, such as a homosexual orientation. This easily results in a ”decreased field of communication” in the workplace, which is characterised by disharmony and a fear of ”being exposed” as a homosexual. Even if many homosexuals today openly declare their sexual orientation – it is said that increasing numbers are ”coming out” – it is also clear that not all homosexuals and bisexuals are willing to talk openly about their sexual orientation. Our surveys and all other indicators show that more people still prefer to conceal their homosexuality rather than show it openly. Often the reason for this ”strategy of concealment” is a fear of the reaction from the individual’s surrounding environment. Many homosexuals experience this as an extremely substantial, daily problem. In these terms homosexuals and bisexuals are an exposed group.</p>
<p>Our proposal for a new law is an attempt to counteract discrimination. In the short term the law’s most important effect should be the provision of a means of redress, including economic compensation, for the individual who is subjected to discrimination. In the longer term the normative and attitude-influencing effect that a law can be expected to have should increase in importance. This longer term effect on employers and the population in general can be presumed to the most important function of the new law.</p>
<h2>Our proposal</h2>
<p>We propose the introduction of a new law that forbids discrimination in working life on the basis of sexual orientation. We also propose certain related changes in other legislation.</p>
<p>The need for a law</p>
<p>Our proposal is motivated mainly on the basis of the principles at issue, but also on the basis of the actual need for anti-discrimination rules that we have concluded exists.</p>
<p>There are no rules in Sweden today that specifically forbid discrimination in working life on the basis of sexual orientation. Such</p>
<p>rules exist however in several other countries, e.g., Denmark and Finland.</p>
<p>It is difficult to measure and statistically prove the existence and extent of discrimination. The parties on the labour market have established as their common viewpoint the idea that there is no need for rules that forbid discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. The experiences and insights of the labour market parties cannot be ignored. However, the surveys carried out by us, and the other research and materials that we have examined, must be interpreted as showing that discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation actually does occur to some extent. The surveys show that discrimination occurs, but not that discrimination is an extremely acute issue. It must therefore be admitted that there are good arguments both for and against the idea of introducing a new law on the issue.</p>
<p>In our considerations we have taken into account the fact that the Government chose to initiate three separate discrimination inquiries for the three discrimination grounds of sexual orientation, ethnic background and disability. The Government has expressed the view that the protection in regards to ethnic background and disability shall be provided by law. As we see it, given this background, rejecting the idea of protection in regard to sexual orientation requires an extremely convincing case for the idea that the need for protective rules regarding sexual orientation is essentially non-existent. The surveys and other materials we have examined cannot be interpreted in this manner. Discrimination occurs. The extent of the discrimination however is difficult to assess.</p>
<p>We have nevertheless concluded that the decisive emphasis should not be placed on the extent to which discrimination occurs. The issues of principle here are the more important factors in favour of a law. Working life is for many people a central part of their lives. It is time for the State to clearly indicate, through legislation, its rejection of various types of prejudicial behaviour in working life towards homosexuals and bisexuals. The repudiation of discrimination, and the principle that a person’s sexual orientation is a private matter that has no role in working life, which therefore should not be allowed  to be taken into account either, are so fundamental that they should be confirmed by legislation that results in consequences for those who violate them. Otherwise there is a risk that the principle will hardly be seen as binding.</p>
<p>It must be concluded that the current legal rules do not provide sufficient protection against discrimination. Thus far the unions have not made discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation into a priority issue. This is why, among other things, it is not enough to turn the issue over to the parties on the labour market. There is a continuing and</p>
<p>substantial need regarding the provision of information about homosexuality. But we do not feel that these types of measures are sufficient.</p>
<p>The law against discrimination in working life on the basis of sexual orientation</p>
<p>Our proposal for a new law means that it shall be forbidden for an employer to discriminate against job applicants and employees on the basis of their sexual orientation. With the term sexual orientation we mean a homosexual, bisexual or heterosexual orientation. We draw a clear dividing line between sexual orientation and sexual behavior or behaviour patterns that can be found among heterosexual persons as well as among homosexual and bisexual persons. Sexual behaviour and variations such as e.g. pedophilia (which is most common among heterosexuals but also occurs among homosexuals and bisexuals) fall outside the protection of the law. Additional examples of the different variations not covered by the law that can be mentioned are exhibitionism, fetishism, nyphomania, sado-masochism, transvestitism, transsexuality and voyeurism. It can be said that these expressions of sexuality are in addition to  or over and above  a person’s sexual orientation. An individual can thus be seen e.g. as a heterosexual and a pedophile - but he or she cannot be seen as being only a pedophile. This means that a job applicant or employee who is denied a job, a promotion etc. on the basis of his or her tendencies or actions as a pedophile, will not be able to refer to this law for protection regardless of his or her sexual orientation.</p>
<p>Discrimination</p>
<p>That discrimination is forbidden means quite simply that homosexuals and bisexuals are not to be treated worse than heterosexuals in working life. The decisive ”test” for determining the existence of discrimination in an individual case is always: ”Would a person with another (i.e. heterosexual) orientation have been treated in the same way?” If the answer is yes then there is no discrimination.</p>
<p>Discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation means that a person is treated less advantageously due to a reason that has a direct or indirect connection with his or her sexual orientation. A less advantageous treatment consists of the idea that the discriminated person has been subjected to a detriment; e.g. been denied a particular job or been given</p>
<p>poorer terms of employment than other employees due to his or her sexual orientation.</p>
<p>The protection against discrimination applies to job applicants and employees when an employer selects candidates for job interviews, makes the decision about employment or undertakes other measures during the employment process. Furthermore the protection applies when the employer makes promotion decisions or selects employees for training for promotion, or uses salary or other employment terms, or takes management decisions, or gives notice, fires, lays off or otherwise undertakes other measures that have a serious effect on an employee. The existence of a decision to actually employ someone is not a prerequisite to a finding of discrimination. Even if there is only one job applicant, he or she can still make a claim of discrimination. Even if the employment process is cut off, and no one else is employed, a discriminatory employment process can still be challenged. This is the case e.g. if an employer does not want to employ a homosexual job applicant because of his or her sexual orientation, and therefore decides to not employ anyone.</p>
<p>Conscious and unconscious discrimination</p>
<p>For a finding of discrimination, it is not necessary that the employer had a discriminatory intent in the meaning of a wilful intent to cause an injury or detriment to the job applicant or employee. It can basically be said that neither a discriminatory intent, nor even negligence, on the behalf of the employer is required. Thus both conscious and unconscious discrimination fall within the scope of the law, if the other prerequisites are fulfilled. The decisive issue is if the results of the treatment involve less than equal treatment.</p>
<p>However, a connection is required between the orientation and the detrimental treatment. To the extent that there was a discriminatory intent, the necessary connection exists. Even if an employer has treated someone detrimentally as a result, e.g., of giving in to the desires of others to avoid having to deal with homosexuals, the connection exists. The employer has thereby allowed a person’s sexual orientation to control his actions. A person’s sexual orientation does not have to be the sole reason or even the primary reason for a particular treatment. It is sufficient if it was one of several factors that affected the employer’s actions.</p>
<p>The structure of the law results in a situation which means that an employer who has detrimentally treated another person in a way that can be seen as discriminatory, will have to be able to explain his actions in</p>
<p>order to avoid a discrimination claim. If the employer can provide a satisfactory explanation for his actions then there will have been no violation of the law. If the employer did not base his actions on the person’s sexual orientation or did not even know about the employee’s orientation, then there is no discrimination under the law. In a case where the employer knew about the employee’s sexual orientation, treated him or her detrimentally, and cannot provide a satisfactory explanation for his actions , there may be a finding of discrimination. The protection from discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation can thus in an extreme case be expressed by saying that uncertainty by an employer about whether a decision or other action is justified or acceptable can lead to a decision that the employer discriminated in a manner that violated the law.</p>
<p>Harassment</p>
<p>Various forms of harassment are a major problem for many homosexuals and bisexuals. Such harassment often depends on negative attitudes toward homosexuals. An employer who finds out that an employee considers himself to be or have been the subject of harassment due to his sexual orientation has a duty to investigate the issue and, when necessary, to undertake the measures that can reasonably be required to ensure that the harassment ceases.</p>
<p>Damages and voidability</p>
<p>An employer who discriminates against a job applicant or an employee can be required to pay for the damages caused by the infringement of the applicant’s/employee’s personal integrity and the economic loss that may have been caused to the employee.</p>
<p>A contract that requires or allows for the type of discrimination that is forbidden according to this law is void. In addition, certain acts, such as a discriminatory termination can be declared to be void by a court, if the employee requests it.</p>
<p>The Discrimination Ombudsman</p>
<p>The Discrimination Ombudsman (DO) will be given the right to represent job applicants and employees before the Labour Court in regard to their discrimination claims.</p>
<p>Other Proposals</p>
<p>The DO – i.e. the current ”Ombudsman for ethnic discrimination” – shall in the future be able to represent clients in cases before the Labour Court both in accordance with the law against ethnic discrimination as well as in regard to sexual orientation. The official title of the DO should therefore be changed to the ”Discrimination Ombudsman” and the Board against Ethnic Discrimination should in the future be called The Discrimination Board. Specific changes in the rules regarding the activities of the DO and the Board against Discrimination are proposed in a new law on the Discrimination Ombudsman .</p>
<p>The Public Health Institute should retain its overall liability for following up the situation of homosexuals and bisexuals in society.</p>
<p>We also propose, as a consequence of the new law against discrimination, changes in the Act concerning trials in  labour-related  disputes  and in the Official Secrets Act .</p>
<p>Consultation</p>
<p>We have consulted with the Committee of Inquiry into Ethnic Discrimination in Working Life (SOU 1997:174) and the Committee of Inquiry into Disability Discrimination in Working Life (SOU 1997:176) as well as with representatives of the parties on the labour market.</p>
