<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Financial crises may lead to significant economic costs as the financial system’s core functions – payment services, access to capital and risk management – are essential for the economy to work properly. A financial crisis may be triggered by the failure of a systemically important financial institution. An institution may be systemically important because it performs activities critical for the functioning of the financial system or because its failure would have significant spillover effects.</p>
<p>To prevent a financial crisis from spreading, governments have many times been forced to intervene and rescue systemically important institutions. These rescues have often had to be made on favourable terms for the institution’s creditors and sometimes also for its owners. Furthermore, expectations of a government rescue may lead systemically important institutions to take greater risks and provide them with less costly financing. This may increase the risk of a financial crisis in the future and cause a distortion of competition.</p>
<p>There therefore needs to be an alternative procedure for reconstructing or winding down systemically important institutions in a way that does not risk triggering a financial crisis. It should also ensure that the institution’s owners and creditors bear an appropriate share of the costs resulting from the institution’s failure. This procedure is called resolution.</p>
<p>On 15 April 2014 and 6 May 2014 respectively, the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers adopted the final European Parliament’s and the Council’s Bank Recovery and Resolution</p>
<p>Directive (BRRD). BRRD provides a framework for the resolution of credit institutions and investment firms, as well as companies belonging to the same group as the aforementioned. The purpose of the Directive is to provide opportunities for reconstructing or winding down these institutions. But another aim of the framework is to avoid that individual institutions develop problems that could necessitate resolution. BRRD therefore contains provisions about resolution, preparations for this procedure and precautionary supervisory measures.</p>
<p>This report presents a proposal incorporating BRRD into Swedish law. In addition to a number of changes in existing laws, this requires two completely new laws, which will replace the Act on Government Support to Credit Institutions from 2008: a new law on resolution and a new law on precautionary state aid for sound credit institutions. The Committee also presents proposals concerning the Stability Fund and the stability fee.</p>
<h2>Crisis Prevention</h2>
<p>As mentioned, BRRD contains provisions on crisis prevention. These include both preparations for resolution and purely supervisory measures. There will be new requirements for the establishment of recovery plans and resolution plans, as well as the possibility of requiring institutions to remove obstacles to an effective resolution. Early intervention, including the appointment of a temporary administrator, is also part of the crisis prevention framework. Early intervention gives the supervisory authorities the chance to prevent a deterioration of the institution’s financial position to the point where resolution is the only alternative. With the exception of the appointment of a temporary administrator, these interventions can be accommodated in Finansinspektionen’s (the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority) interventions as they now stand. The crisis prevention work will also include the option of writing down and converting debts that can be included in the capital base and requiring institutions to have sufficient liabilities suitable for bail-in. With the exception of resolution planning, it is the Committee’s opinion that Finansinspektionen should be the authority in Sweden responsible for the crisis prevention work. This is to avoid a situation where there might otherwise be two authorities with supervisory functions.</p>
<h2>Resolution</h2>
<p>The basic aim of resolution is to reconstruct or wind down financial institutions that fail, i.e. are in financial distress, without causing considerable disturbance and interruption of essential services. Resolution can thus be initiated as an alternative to bankruptcy or liquidation. A resolution authority should be responsible for managing the procedure and see that the purpose of the procedure, which is primarily to address serious disruptions in the financial system, is achieved in the best possible way. In the Committee’s opinion, the Swedish National Debt Office, which is currently bank support authority, would be the appropriate resolution authority.</p>
<p>When an institution is placed under resolution, control of the institution is transferred to the resolution authority. The resolution decision also entails a number of other legal consequences such as prohibiting the seizure of assets. The resolution authority also has the right to stop the fulfilment of contracts or require fulfilment.</p>
<p>One of the main reasons for placing a failing institution under resolution is that the continuance of its activities is essential to avoid serious disruptions in the financial system. Therefore, either the activity has to be transferred to a financially strong actor or the company has to be reconstructed. There are four resolution tools for this purpose: - The sale of business tool  whereby the resolution authority can sell assets, liabilities and shares in an institution under resolution to a private purchaser. - The bridge institution tool  whereby the resolution authority can transfer assets, liabilities or shares from the institution under resolution to a temporarily established institution controlled by the resolution authority. - The asset separation tool,  whereby the resolution authority can transfers assets that do not lend themselves to immediate disposal to a specially established asset management company, which instead winds down the business over time. This tool may only be applied together with another resolution tool. - The  bail-in  tool  whereby the resolution authority can write down the liabilities of an institution under resolution or convert them to shares. Liabilities can be converted to shares in both an institution under resolution and its parent company, but can also be converted to shares in a bridge institution or an asset management company.</p>
<p>The resolution authority’s use of resolution tools is based on a number of powers enabling it to intervene in an institution under resolution and take action against its owners and creditors. In certain circumstances, these powers may also be used independently, without associating them with a particular tool.</p>
<p>Before the resolution authority uses any tool or power that may lead to any creditor losses, the resolution authority is to take measures forcing owners to bear losses first and fully. This is to maintain the order of precedence that would have applied if the institution had instead been forced into bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Resolution involves intervention in individuals’ rights. For this reason, there are a number of provisions that limit and impose requirements on the resolution procedure in order to preserve a fundamental right to property for different stakeholders. One important provision of this kind is the requirement for an assessment of whether any owner’s or creditor’s financial outcome is worse than in a normal insolvency procedure. If so, the affected party has the right to compensation.</p>
<h2>Use of state financing and the resolution reserve</h2>
<p>Even if the state generally uses the bail-in tool to capitalise the institution under resolution, it may be necessary to provide external financing in the form of state aid in order for the resolution to succeed. One reason for this is that liabilities, despite the requirement on the level of liabilities suitable for bail-in, may need to be exempted from write-downs and conversion because of system stability concerns.</p>
<p>To enable the use of state aid in connection with resolution measures, BRRD requires the establishment of a special financing arrangement for resolution. A financing arrangement is to be financed by fees paid by institutions that could be subject to resolution. There are special rules governing the use of the financing arrangement.</p>
<p>In Sweden there are currently two different systems for financing public intervention in distressed financial institutions: the Stability Fund, which can be used to provide state aid to credit institutions if it is considered necessary to safeguard financial stability, and the Deposit Insurance Fund, which is used to finance depositor protection. To promote the most effective and flexible financing of government intervention possible, the Committee proposes that the financing for government support in connection with general financial crises and crises in individual financial institutions come from three separate funds. Government measures concerning institutions under resolution should mainly be financed by funds from a newly formed resolution reserve. State measures taken as precautionary measures related to credit institutions that are not subject to resolution (such as guarantees and capital injections for solvent institutions) should be financed from the Stability Fund. The Deposit Guarantee Fund should be used to finance compensation from the deposit insurance scheme and the protection depositors are entitled to in resolution. The Committee also makes a proposal on how the fees for the resolution reserve should be designed and recommends that the fee for the Stability Fund be abolished. It also proposes a division of the funds currently in the Stability Fund between the new resolution reserve and the modified Stability Fund.</p>
<p>However, the Directive contains limitations on the use of the resolution reserve and other state funds in resolution. Before public funds can be provided, a write-down or conversion of owners’ and creditors’ claims equivalent to 8 per cent of the institution’s total liabilities and capital is required. Alternatively, the requirement can be calculated as a contribution by owners and creditors of the equivalent of 20 per cent of the institution’s riskweighted assets. But to be able to calculate the requirement in the latter way, the resolution reserve must amount to at least 3 per cent of the deposits guaranteed. For the Swedish authorities to have as much freedom of action as possible, the Committee proposes that the resolution reserve be at least 3 per cent of guaranteed deposits.</p>
<p>Moreover, it is possible in certain circumstances to use regular government funds within the framework of resolution to provide a capital injection or for the government to temporarily assume ownership of a company in resolution. According to BRRD, these measures – the government stabilisation tools – do not have to be incorporated into law. The Committee proposes that they be incorporated into Swedish law and that it be possible to use the Stability Fund for financing such government interventions.</p>
<h2>A new law on precautionary state support</h2>
<p>The proposal for a new law on resolution entails replacing the rules in the Act on Government Support to Credit Institutions that apply to handling institutions in crisis with the rules in the resolution regime. The Committee also proposes adjusting the rules in the Act on Government Support to Credit Institutions on support to sound credit institutions and the financing of support of this kind in order to comply with BRRD’s rules in this respect by means of a new law on precautionary state support. It is proposed that support can be provided through loans, guarantees of newly issued debt instruments or capital injections. It should also be possible to provide the Riksbank with guarantees in connection with its liquidity support.</p>
