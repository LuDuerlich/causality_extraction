<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Remit</h2>
<p>Our remit is to investigate and submit proposals for an environmental tax on single-use items. The goal is for the tax to be a policy instrument to support a transition to a more resource-efficient and bio-based circular economy. It should also mitigate the negative environmental impact of inappropriate disposal of single-use items that results in littering in the environment. Reduced use of singleuse items can also prevent waste and contribute to reduced greenhouse gas emissions at the production stage and in waste management. We will propose the scope of the tax, who will be liable to pay tax and in what amounts the tax will be payable. To the extent that this is justified, we will also investigate solutions other than taxation that can reduce the use of single-use items and thus reduce littering and waste generation. If such alternative solutions are judged to be more cost-effective, or more justifiable than taxation for other reasons, these solutions will be presented.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>A single-use item is a product intended for single or short-term use. It is not intended to be reused several times during its life cycle. We use large quantities of single-use items in our society today. The high consumption of single-use items is due to them being convenient to use, easy to obtain and not requiring cleaning after use. They are also easy to dispose of. But, above all, they are inexpensive.</p>
<p>Greater use of single-use items leads to greater littering. Some single-use items – especially those used for food and beverages consumed on the go – rank high in the statistics for the most common litter in towns and parks, as well as at beaches.</p>
<p>Products that are used only once and then become waste are not resource efficient. With single use, we extract resources, refine products, use them for a short time and then discard them, often without recycling the material and in some cases in nature. Since many singleuse items contain plastic, they do not naturally degrade in the environment, and also contribute to higher carbon dioxide emissions than, for example, paper products.</p>
<h2>Considerations and proposals Choice of instruments</h2>
<p>We are to primarily propose a tax on single-use items, but the remit also includes investigating solutions other than taxation, to the extent that this is justified. In one chapter, we discuss how different instruments meet the criteria that are important when selecting instruments. We discuss how different instruments can address failures identified in the market. An important reason why single-use items are consumed to such a great extent is that they are inexpensive and the price does not reflect the environmental impact they have. A tax is an effective instrument to remedy a market failure that can be attributed to economic factors. It gives companies and consumers the opportunity to adapt to varying degrees based on their individual circumstances and is thus a more cost-effective instrument than a prohibition.</p>
<h2>Overarching choice of path</h2>
<p>In one chapter, we discuss overarching issues regarding taxable products and materials.</p>
<p>An important question when choosing the path forward is whether it is possible and appropriate to tax all single-use plastic items. Plastic is a common raw material for single-use items. As much as 40 per cent of the plastic produced goes to the manufacture of single-use packaging, both in Europe and globally. Plastic production worldwide has increased twentyfold since the 1960s and is projected to double again over the next 20 years. As long as the production and use of singleuse items continues to follow linear material flows, there will be serious negative consequences for the environment. Littering statistics show that single-use plastic items are very common among litter. A key question, therefore, is whether perhaps a first choice for us would be to tax all single-use plastic items.</p>
<p>We do not propose a tax on all single-use items. The reasons are as follows. There is no single explanation for the high consumption of single-use items, but there are various market failures that explain the use of different categories of single-use items. It is therefore difficult to solve the problems through a single solution. A general tax on single-use items would also require a large number of exceptions, as some single-use items are necessary in society in the absence of any decent alternatives. Legislation would be complicated. Furthermore, for some single-use items, other instruments are already in use, or are about to be introduced. It is often unproductive that several policy instruments apply to the same product. It may also be difficult to reconcile a general tax on single-use items with our international commitments, such as EU state aid rules.</p>
<p>Another important question is whether the tax should be differentiated to favour items made of materials that are bio-based, recycled or fully biodegradable.</p>
<p>In theory, we are positive towards taxation being differentiated in favour of recycled plastic within the framework of a tax on singleuse items. There are sound arguments in favour of the need to stimulate the use of recycled plastic, and tax relief could in itself be such an economic policy instrument that could have positive effects. If such a differentiated tax is to be introduced, there must be clear definitions of recycled plastics and reliable methods that allow verification of the proportion of recycled material in a product. This is currently lacking. There is as yet no established common standard for defining recycled plastics. Thus, there are no possibilities to control or trace the amount of recycled material which would be needed for a differentiated tax. Work is underway to develop global standards in this area, and there may soon be reason to reconsider differentiation.</p>
<p>Similar problems also exist for differentiation in favour of biobased plastics. There are some common standards, but today’s methods of analysis are expensive and less suitable for individual products. Here, too, work is in progress, and soon more accessible and less costly analyses may be available in Europe. There are also other arguments against differentiation, such as that the availability of bioplastics is limited and, like fossil-based plastics, bio-based plastics do not degrade if they end up in the environment.</p>
<p>There are degradable plastics that have had positive results in life cycle analyses, but there are several arguments against differentiation for degradable plastics. For example, such plastics are recycled through industrial composting, which is not possible throughout northern Europe. Nor has it been scientifically verified thus far that biodegradable plastics fully degrade in the environment, and so the assumption until further notice should be that they cause the same kinds of littering problems as other plastics.</p>
<p>We therefore believe that, at present, differentiated tax rates should not be proposed based on the type of plastic raw material that is used, but the issue should be reconsidered when the tax is to be evaluated. However, the tax should be differentiated through different tax rates to take into account how much plastic a product contains.</p>
<p>Our remit primarily concerns single-use items containing plastic. Single-use items made of other materials should also be investigated if the materials are not fully biodegradable and if the items result in both littering and other forms of negative environmental impact, or if this is specifically justified for the purposes of the tax. We have not found sufficiently strong arguments to extend the scope of taxation to single-use items not containing plastic, and we assess that the phasing-out of plastic can be seen as an initial step that is taking place concurrently with a transition to multiple-use articles.</p>
<h2>Selection of single-use items for further consideration</h2>
<p>An important part of the assignment is to investigate which singleuse items should be covered by the intended tax. Based on the objecttives of the tax and other assumptions stated in the committee’s terms of reference, we have developed a number of criteria for selecting single-use items for further analysis: 1. The item is a  single-use item. 2. The  single-use item contains – plastic, or – other materials that are not fully biodegradable, if the singleuse item results in littering and other negative environmental effects, or – other materials, if specifically justified for the purpose of the tax. 3. The  single-use item is not subject to other excise duty. 4. The  single-use item may be made available on the market, i.e. it is not prohibited, nor is it about to become prohibited. 5. The  single-use item has a negative environmental impact – when littered in the sea and in nature, – due to it consuming relatively large quantities of resources in the form of raw materials, energy and other inputs, – due to it generating large quantities of waste, – due to it not being recycled, or only to a limited extent, and – due to it giving rise to greenhouse gas emissions during manufacture or waste management.</p>
<p>The single-use items we have selected for further consideration fulfil all of criteria 1–4 and all sub-criteria under point 5.</p>
<p>After analysing consumption levels, waste quantities and environmental impact for different types of single-use items, as well as whether they are covered by existing instruments that can affect whether or not they should be considered for a tax on single-use items, we have chosen to proceed with single-use items in the form of cups for beverages and food containers, as well as packaging for sweets, ice cream and snacks. There are also other items that have high levels of consumption, lead to large quantities of waste and contribute to climate impact. These include beverage containers, disposable gloves, nappies and sanitary towels/tampons. However, for various reasons we have chosen not to proceed with these.</p>
<h2>Cups for beverages and food containers</h2>
<p>We propose the introduction of a tax on single-use items in the form of cups for beverages and food containers. The reasons for this are as follows: These products are currently consumed in large quantities and consumption is also expected to increase. They also account for large waste streams, and only a small proportion of them are recycled after use. Furthermore, they come high up in the littering statistics for towns and parks, as well as for beaches. There are also demands from the EU that Member States must take the necessary steps to reduce the consumption of such products in an ambitious and enduring manner. Sweden thus has an obligation to take measures to reduce consumption. Reduced consumption of such single-use items is expected to lead to lower environmental impact in the form of reduced resource consumption, reduced waste generation and reduced greenhouse gas emissions in the production and waste management stages. Reduced consumption of such single-use items in favour of multiple-use alternatives also leads to less littering and greater circularity.</p>
<p>We propose that taxes be levied on these product categories if they consist wholly or partly of plastic and are intended for single use. Tax shall be payable at SEK 5 per cup and at SEK 7 per food container, but deductions may be made for cups for beverages and food containers with a low plastic content. At a maximum of 1 per cent plastic content, a deduction may be made of SEK 4 of the tax that would otherwise be payable for a cup and of SEK 5 of the tax that would otherwise be payable for a food container. At a maximum of 10 per cent plastic content, a deduction may be made of SEK 2 of the tax that would otherwise be paid for a cup and of SEK 3 of the tax that would otherwise be paid for a food container. Liable for tax are those who manufacture, bring in, receive or import taxable goods. However, taxable goods brought in, received and imported to a very small extent are exempted from tax liability. In addition, exceptions are made for a natural person manufacturing, bringing in, receiving and importing taxable goods intended for their or their family’s personal use.</p>
<p>In addition to new legislation on tax on single-use items, certain consequential amendments to other legislation are also proposed. It is proposed that the proposals in the sections relating to registration as an authorised warehousekeeper enter into force on 1 September 2021. It is proposed that the other parts of the proposals enter into force on 1 November 2021.</p>
<p>An evaluation of the tax should be made within two years of its introduction. What should then be evaluated is how effective the tax has been in steering towards reduced consumption and whether there is reason to change anything in the tax structure.</p>
<h2>Packaging for sweets, ice cream and snacks</h2>
<p>We have considered but chosen not to propose a tax on single-use items in the form of packaging for sweets, ice cream and snacks. We have also considered but chosen not to propose a compulsory deposit system. Neither do we propose that any other policy instruments be introduced for these items in addition to those that are now in the process of being introduced as a result of new EU requirements.</p>
<p>Packaging products used for sweets, ice cream and snacks are considered to constitute such single-use items that the intended tax is to cover. They come high up in the littering statistics for towns and parks, as well as for beaches. They are used only once and then become waste. Furthermore, they often consist of complex material compositions that make it difficult to recycle the materials, which is why a large part of the packaging collected is sent for incineration. Since much of the packaging contains plastic, it also contributes to higher carbon dioxide emissions than, for example, paper packaging.</p>
<p>Taxes and charges are often suitable instruments for achieving a change in behaviour, but in this case it is difficult to see how a tax can steer towards more environmentally friendly packaging solutions and thus lead to environmental benefits in such a way that reflects the purpose of the tax. Based on a discussion about price elasticity for this type of goods, a price increase in the form of a tax is not expected to lead to a significant reduction in demand. A tax is therefore deemed to have low potential to achieve the goals we wish to achieve. Within the EU, a decision has recently been made on changes with demands for measures that exert control upwards in the waste hierarchy. These are mainly aimed at producers who place packaging on the market. A tax where the consumer is not able to choose another more environmentally friendly option that is not taxed may lead to reduced demand for the food itself, which in turn leads to reduced sales among the companies that sell these products. We do not yet know what effect the new EU rules may have, but there may be reasons not to introduce another policy instrument that steers towards the same goal, where it is uncertain what effect a tax may have.</p>
<p>We have discussed other policy instruments for this category, such as bans and information, and have considered a compulsory deposit system. For various reasons, we do not propose any of these alternative instruments. Instead, the effects of future policy instruments should be awaited. Later, it may be relevant to reconsider the issue of additional instruments.</p>
<h2>Review for increased compliance with the ban on littering</h2>
<p>One of the purposes of our taxation proposal is to mitigate the negative environmental impact of littering. Our proposal leads to fewer single-use cups for beverages and food containers in circulation, which should reduce the number of such products ending up as litter. However, the fact that littering takes place is not only determined by the supply of these items. It is also due to a lack of information and non-compliance with the ban on littering. We are therefore devoting a chapter to the issue of littering itself. We review the problems associated with non-compliance with the littering ban and present the arguments about any possible changes to the current sanction system that may be worthy of further investigation. Our conclusions are that the penalty provisions for littering should be reviewed, and that particular consideration should be given to whether the exception for minor littering should be abolished, or whether minor littering should be decriminalised and penalties replaced by administrative sanctions.</p>
<h2>Consequences</h2>
<p>The proposed tax is estimated in an initial stage to boost public finances by approximately SEK 3.8 billion per year. Revenues will subsequently gradually decrease when there is an ever-greater transi-</p>
<p>tion from single-use plastic items to multiple-use and single-use items in materials other than plastic.</p>
<p>Reduced consumption of cups for beverages and food containers leads to several environmental benefits. A transition to multiple-use articles reduces the consumption of resources used in manufacturing and also prevents the large amount of waste that arises. The impact on climate is mitigated when the transition is made to multiple-use alternatives, provided that they are used adequate number of times. If single-use plastic items are replaced with single-use items made of renewable materials, carbon dioxide emissions will also decrease. Consumption of other resources, such as land and water, may instead increase. Littering is expected to decrease as the consumption of single-use items is reduced. The negative environmental impact caused by plastic litter is expected to decrease when plastic items are re- placed by plastic-free materials that more readily degrade in the en- vironment.</p>
<p>The tax is expected to incentivise all actors in society to more widely use multiple-use cups for beverages and food containers, as well as single-use cups and food containers in materials other than plastic. Furthermore, the proposed deduction that allows for lower taxation is expected to incentivise increased use of single-use items with a lower plastic content.</p>
<p>The size of the effect of the tax will depend on how the actors react to it. We assess that there are five potential scenarios after the tax has been introduced:</p>
<p>1. A major reduction in consumption and a positive environmental impact due to most consumers choosing to use their own cups for beverages and food containers or joining a deposit system for  multiple-use alternatives.</p>
<p>2. A major reduction in consumption and a positive environmental impact due to the tax creating opportunities for development and innovation regarding cups for beverages and food containers in materials that are better for the environment than plastic.</p>
<p>3. No effect, because consumers continue to buy  single-use cups for beverages and food containers despite higher prices.</p>
<p>4. No positive environmental impact, because the tax instead creates incentives to use materials that are environmentally inferior.</p>
<p>5. Consumers choose not to buy takeaway food and beverages, which leads to negative consequences for companies that sell the products and for cafés and restaurants that lose key customer groups.</p>
<p>According to our assumptions, the tax is estimated to lead in an initial stage to consumption of cups for beverages and food containers fall- ing by about 25 per cent. Reduced demand for taxed cups for beverages and food containers affects companies that manufacture and import these single-use items. However, most companies should be able to switch to selling multiple-use alternatives and increase the supply of plastic-free items as they become available on the market.</p>
<p>Cafés and restaurants that sell takeaway food and beverages can reduce their costs by either offering customers the option of using their own cup and food container or the opportunity to join a cir- cular deposit system for multiple-use alternatives. In the latter case, the cafés and restaurants would wash up the items themselves or use</p>
<p>a commercial  washing-up service. They then avoid costs for purchas- ing single-use items but instead incur costs for washing-up. Our calculations show that the cost of washing-up does not exceed the cost of purchasing single-use items. The increased cost incurred on taxable items is expected to be passed onto the consumer, which may entail a risk that consumers will choose not to buy takeaway food and drink to the same extent as before. This can lead to reduced sales for the café and restaurant industry, along with fewer jobs.</p>
<p>At the same time, the tax is expected to create new business opportunities for companies that manufacture and import multiple- use items, as well as for companies that can offer services such as circular deposit systems for multiple-use alternatives or washing-up services. The deposit systems can in turn create a demand for digital solutions that can be used for such systems. All options entail an increased need for labour.</p>
<p>Small companies that may be adversely affected by the tax are smaller cafés and restaurants, as well as food trucks, food courts and smaller kiosks that lack their own washing-up facilities and have limited opportunities to buy external services in this regard.</p>
<p>Grocery stores that sell prepackaged food and beverages for collec- tion are affected by the tax. As there is not the same opportunity for the consumer to choose a multiple-use alternative, the tax entails</p>
<p>increased costs for the consumer, which in turn may lead to them choosing to buy takeaway food and drink at competing cafés and restaurants instead. Grocery stores that sell multipacks of cups and plates are also affected by the tax, as sharply reduced demand can be expected as a result of the tax. The food companies that sell pre- packaged food to grocery stores may also be affected by the tax.</p>
<p>For an average consumer, the tax is estimated to entail additional costs of approximately SEK 300–900 per year if they continue to buy food and drink in taxable cups for beverages and food containers. If the consumer instead chooses to buy food and drink in multiple-use alternatives, there will be no cost increase. Instead, this can lead to lower prices, as the cost of purchasing single-use items is no longer added to the price. The tax is expected to affect single households and people aged 18–29 to a greater extent, as it is these individuals who most frequently buy takeaway food and drink. Women and men are expected to be equally affected by the tax.</p>
<p>Those liable for tax are expected to experience increased admin- istrative costs of an average of approximately SEK 37 000 per year per company.</p>
<p>During the period of the inquiry, a pandemic caused by a novel coronavirus has arisen. At present, it is difficult to assess how the current pandemic will affect society at large and the industries that will be affected in particular. We have thus not been able to take this into account when drafting our proposals.</p>
