<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>According to the Commission of Inquiry’s terms of reference, the control of payments from the welfare system should be coordinated and strengthened. The Commission of Inquiry’s main task has been to consider whether a function for system-wide risk analysis, selection and control should be established in order to prevent irregular and incorrect payments and to ensure that payments are made to the right payee.</p>
<p>We propose that a new government agency, the Payment Control Agency, be established on 1 July 2022. This agency shall detect and prevent irregularities in payments from the state welfare system. The organisation shall complement the controls performed by welfare agencies. Responsibility for case management shall remain with each agency and our proposals do not limit the controls carried out by the agencies within the framework of each form of benefit or support. The Payment Control Agency shall also administer a system of transaction accounts for payments.</p>
<p>The purpose of our proposal is to reduce irregular payments, thereby preventing welfare crime from having an adverse effect on the welfare system.</p>
<h2>An altered problem profile for irregular welfare payments</h2>
<p>The past two decades have seen major societal changes that have had a significant impact on the welfare system. As society as a whole has been digitised, so too has the welfare system. The mobility of labour between countries has increased, as has the involvement of private providers in the welfare system. These changes have had a number of consequences. One negative consequence is new possibilities for increasingly sophisticated and deliberate abuse of the welfare system.</p>
<p>Where to a large extent the problem was once one of individuals deceiving the welfare system – for example, colliding payments – today, we see an entirely different type of approach to welfare fraud. Companies and identity fraud are used as tools to improperly obtain welfare payments. While the vast majority of private-sector welfare providers are earnest, the difficulty lies in identifying those used to abuse the welfare system. Digitisation has created economies of scale for identity fraud that were once non-existent.</p>
<p>Those who systematically exploit the welfare system’s weak points are experts at what they do. They move between welfare systems, identifying and exploiting loopholes in regulations and gaps in controls. Public authorities are not as flexible. Among other things, this is due to regulatory constraints and a lack of opportunities to communicate information regarding new ploys. In addition, the complexity of these crimes often demands extensive investigation to identify and counter criminal intent.</p>
<p>These new methods for exploiting the welfare system therefore place new demands on welfare agencies. It is more difficult to detect, investigate and address fraud involving multiple individuals and that may concern more than a single agency. Taking the welfare system as a whole, there is insufficient overall preparedness to curb such activities. The information that would be needed to detect irregularities is often held by another agency. It may well be that the decision-making public authority does not have access to the data or is not permitted to use it to detect and prevent irregular payments due to confidentiality rules and data protection regulations. It is not possible to utilise data from different parts of the welfare system – for example, payment data, certificates and other control data or data from the Swedish Tax Agency – to the necessary extent to effectively detect and prevent irregular payments.</p>
<p>The conditions for conducting control activities also vary from one agency to the next. Issues of control are prioritised differently at different agencies and those priorities change over time. This excludes a long-term view of control issues and leads to disjointed control activities. Although public authorities expend a considerable amount of energy countering irregular payments, they all do so based on their own operations. There is no one tasked with or even equipped to work with irregular payments based on the welfare system as a whole.</p>
<p>All of this contributes to a situation in which those who exploit the system tend to constantly remain one step ahead, while government agencies lag behind in their work to control welfare payments.</p>
<h2>The control activities of government agencies must be supplemented</h2>
<p>New methods are required in order to get to grips with advanced schemes to defraud the welfare system. In our opinion, the next step in building our defences against systematic welfare fraud is to create joint structures equipped to deal with them. If we are to counter irregular payments, the welfare system must be viewed holistically. This demands a long-term vision, continuity and cohesive control of the welfare system in its entirety.</p>
<p>It is therefore our opinion that a specific agency should be established to counter irregular payments and welfare fraud from a holistic perspective. This implies an agency permitted to focus on the task of countering irregular payments without competing additional tasks. The creation of a new government agency sends a clear signal that the Government is prioritising the issue of combating irregular payments from the welfare system. The agency may also have a preventive effect. Furthermore, a government agency with a stated responsibility for these issues can contribute to developing cooperation in the field. This will reduce crime and reinforce confidence in the welfare system.</p>
<p>Our proposals include the central parts of the welfare state in which public confidence is particularly important, meaning that the new agency’s mandate to prevent and detect irregular payments will cover the Swedish Public Employment Service, Swedish Board of Student Finance (CSN), Swedish Social Insurance Agency and Swedish Pensions Agency. The Swedish Tax Agency and, to a certain extent, unemployment benefit funds are also included. A number of other public authorities will also be required to provide data to the Payment Control Agency and will receive notifications regarding irregularities.</p>
<h2>A system of transaction accounts</h2>
<p>In order to create a collective structure for payments from the state welfare systems and the Swedish Tax Agency, we propose the establishment of a system of transaction accounts. This system will administer payments from the welfare systems and the Swedish Tax Agency. A collective function separate from other agencies provides a holistic overview of welfare payments while at the same time limiting the risk of data being disseminated to a greater extent than necessary.</p>
<p>The transaction account system will overall be more efficient for the state, among other things because welfare payments can be managed collectively and account details for payees will only need to be administered by a single public authority, rather than several. The transaction account system shall be regulated in a separate law and supplementary ordinance.</p>
<p>Data from the transaction account system shall form the basis for the Agency’s data analysis and sampling to detect and prevent irregular payments.</p>
<h2>Data analysis and selection</h2>
<p>The Payment Control Agency will analyse data and conduct checks to detect irregular welfare payments that decision-making authorities have difficulty in detecting based on the data available to them individually. The operations conducted by the Payment Control Agency will focus on intentional errors and more advanced schemes to defraud the welfare system, where one or more individuals seek to obtain funds on false grounds. The ability to cross-check data from various welfare agencies allows the Agency to detect irregularities in a manner that is not currently feasible. This is particularly applicable to cases where data indicative of irregular payments is stored by an agency other than the decision-making authority. It also makes it possible to compare information supplied to different government agencies, thus detecting irregularities.</p>
<p>In addition to payment data from the transaction account system, the Agency will need to use certain data held by the decision-making authority as a basis for data analysis and selection; for example, decisions, employer certificates and contact details. Certain other data from public authorities will also form the basis for data analysis and selection, including registry data from the Swedish Companies Registration Office and Swedish Enforcement Authority. The Agency will also be permitted to use personal data from the Swedish Tax Agency such as certain tax information and information from the population register. It will also be possible to use certain data from unemployment benefit funds.</p>
<h2>Enquiries</h2>
<p>Payments selected based on the Agency’s data analysis and selection will need to be processed and sorted in order to provide an effective basis on which welfare agencies can detect and prevent irregular welfare payments. We propose that this can be done in two stages: initial and in-depth enquiry. The Agency’s enquiries shall be regulated in a separate law.</p>
<p>Initial enquiry involves the processing and sorting of all selection results handed over by the Agency’s data analysis and selection department. It may be justified for the Agency to conduct an indepth enquiry of certain selections; i.e., a supplementary investigation. In-depth enquiries may be initiated when there is reason to assume that an irregular payment has been made. Selections where it seems likely that more than one government agency is affected should be prioritised. When conducting an in-depth enquiry, the Agency shall be permitted to obtain supplementary documentation.</p>
<p>The Payment Control Agency shall inform other public authorities and unemployment benefit funds of the results of the enquiries. The enquiries shall support control activities conducted by decisionmaking authorities and unemployment benefit funds. The Payment Control Agency shall not review or overrule decisions taken by other public authorities.</p>
<h2>Support and monitor</h2>
<p>The Payment Control Agency shall support and monitor the work of government agencies and unemployment benefit funds to counter irregular welfare payments. There is much to be gained from the exchange of knowledge, joint analysis of problems and coordinated measures. The Payment Control Agency shall constitute a platform for interagency activities to combat irregular payments.</p>
<p>Through its specific competence in control issues, the Agency may become an important consultative body when changes affecting the welfare systems are considered. This is particularly important in the event of major or rapid changes that may open new windows of opportunity for those who wish to systematically defraud the welfare system.</p>
<p>The Agency shall also be tasked with submitting a consolidated report to the Government every third year as a basis for ongoing work to counter irregular welfare payments.</p>
<p>We propose that the Government adopt a goal of reducing irregular payments, and that this goal should be followed up in the Budget Bill.</p>
<h2>Processing of personal data</h2>
<p>The Agency’s processing of personal data, especially in data analysis and selection, constitutes an infringement of individual privacy. In our opinion, this infringement is proportionate to the purpose of detecting and preventing irregular welfare payments and thereby countering welfare crime. We propose a law to facilitate and regulate the processing of personal data deemed necessary for the Agency to carry out its proposed assignment. This proposal includes a number of safeguards, including restrictions on searches and access to personal data for the Agency’s staff, as well as rules on access control.</p>
<p>The ordinance shall specify the data that the Payment Control Agency is permitted to use when performing data analysis and sampling. This is to safeguard the principle of data minimisation and to strengthen the protection of privacy.</p>
<h2>Public Access to Information and Secrecy</h2>
<p>Secrecy rules are necessary to protect both individual rights and the public interest in the Agency’s operations. In the operations of the Agency, absolute secrecy shall apply to all data concerning the personal and financial circumstances of individuals and legal entities. Data will therefore always remain secret and shall not be disclosed to public authorities or others unless there are any provisions overriding secrecy. We also propose that it should be possible to classify as secret any information regarding the methods, models and risk factors associated with the analysis and selection conducted to detect and prevent irregular welfare payments.</p>
<p>The Agency’s operations presuppose the exchange of data with other public authorities and stakeholders. To facilitate the exchange of data, we propose obligations overriding secrecy regarding the exchange of intelligence and information. This proposal implies that the following public authorities shall provide certain specified data to the Agency for data analysis and selection: the Swedish Public Employment Service, Swedish Companies Registration Office, CSN, Swedish Social Insurance Agency, Health and Social Care Inspectorate (IVO), Swedish Migration Agency, Swedish Pensions Agency, Swedish Tax Agency and unemployment benefit funds. Government agencies, unemployment benefit funds and credit institutions shall provide information concerning named natural persons or legal entities that may be of significance to the Agency’s in-depth enquiries.</p>
<p>The Swedish Act on the Obligation to Report Irregular Welfare Payments (SFS 2008:206) shall apply to the Payment Control Agency. The Agency may also uncover other likely irregularities in authority decisions and registrations. The Swedish Companies Registration Office, IVO, Swedish Migration Board and Swedish Tax Agency shall therefore be informed when enquiries reveal irregularities in their decisions or registers.</p>
<h2>The Payment Control Agency</h2>
<p>The Agency shall be organised as a board-supervised authority. The Agency should be located in a region with a large labour market and in close proximity to a town or city with one or more higher education institutions.</p>
<p>Within the Agency there shall be a privacy protection council tasked with exercising ongoing insight into the measures taken to ensure the protection of privacy within the organisation.</p>
<p>The Agency’s assignment is expected to require a staff of 80 fulltime equivalents once the organisation is fully developed after three years.</p>
<p>The Agency’s operations place high demands on information security and data protection.</p>
<h2>Well-functioning cooperation is a prerequisite for the Agency’s operations</h2>
<p>In particular, the Payment Control Agency shall cooperate with the Swedish Public Employment Service, CSN, the Swedish Social Insurance Agency, the Swedish Migration Board, the Swedish Pensions Agency and the Swedish Tax Agency in the interests of preventing irregular payments. Corresponding assignments shall be included in the Government’s instructions to each agency. Instructions to the Payment Control Agency shall also include a directive to cooperate with other interested parties.</p>
<p>The Payment Control Agency should participate in interagency cooperation against organised crime as a network authority.</p>
<h2>Other issues</h2>
<p>The Commission of Inquiry has also been tasked with considering whether municipalities should be able to voluntarily connect to the function, the pros and cons of coordinated data provision for the individual, as well as investigating whether the function should take over responsibility for debt collection on behalf of decision-making authorities.</p>
<p>There is insufficient evidence regarding the extent and nature of irregular welfare payments in the municipal sector. The problems appear to be similar to that for state welfare payments. However, there are a number of major differences between state and municipal welfare payments. Therefore, the possibility of municipalities connecting to the functions provided by the Payment Control Agency requires further study. The possibility of regional authorities connecting to these functions should also be examined.</p>
<p>The transaction account system will simplify matters for individuals, in as much as they will only need to provide their account details for payment once and to a single agency; otherwise, we have been unable to identify a need for the Payment Control Agency to coordinate further reporting from individuals.</p>
<p>Consideration of gathering the administration of repayment claims with the Payment Control Agency should be delayed until certain regulatory changes in that area have been implemented and taken effect. Among other things, this applies to rules for housing benefit, which accounts for the majority of repayment claims from the Swedish Social Insurance Agency.</p>
<h2>Financing the proposals</h2>
<p>Our main proposal is for additional funding so that funds are not taken from existing welfare operations. Alternatively, financing may be achieved by reducing administrative appropriations to the affected public authorities. The latter should then be achieved through a general reduction in appropriations for those authorities that are to be covered by the transaction account system. Reductions should be proportionate in relation to the operating costs of the public authority in question. The public authorities that we propose should join the transaction account system, and are therefore affected by the financeing proposal, are the Swedish Public Employment Service, CSN, the Swedish Social Insurance Agency, the Swedish Pensions Agency and the Swedish Tax Agency.</p>
<p>The total annual cost of a fully developed organisation is calculated to be in the region of SEK 153 million. The cost of bank charges will be reduced for the affected public authorities and corresponding appropriations should be transferred to the Payment Control Agency. The remaining annual funding requirement for a fully developed organisation is SEK 120 million.</p>
<h2>Rapid implementation</h2>
<p>There is a pressing need to implement our proposals as soon as possible so that the Payment Control Agency can commence operations. The detection and prevention of irregular welfare payments is an issue that must be highly prioritised. We propose that the Agency should commence operations on 1 July 2022. The new laws and ordinances should enter into force when the Agency begins its work.</p>
<p>The connection of public authority payments to the transaction account system should take place successively, with all relevant payments from the affected agencies being made via the system no later than 1 July 2025.</p>
<h2>Consequences of the proposals Fewer irregular payments and a reduction in welfare crime</h2>
<p>In our assessment, these proposals will lead to fewer irregular payments and therefore a reduction in welfare crime. Primarily, we believe that the proposals will have an impact on intentional errors and systematic and organised welfare fraud.</p>
<p>Our proposals will lead to irregular payments being detected at an earlier stage than is currently the case. Earlier detection significantly increases the chances of recovering irregular payments by demanding repayment. By using data analysis and selection, the Payment Control Agency will uncover irregularities that currently go undetected. The Agency’s ability to co-process population register data with data from welfare systems will also lead to identity fraud being detected to a greater extent.</p>
<p>The Agency’s enquiries means that an additional organisation will examine irregularities, supplementing the work of existing government agencies, in particular with regard to advanced fraud that affects more than one welfare system. For example, schemes involving companies and identity fraud that are currently difficult to detect, as individual authorities lack access to the necessary data to uncover and investigate them.</p>
<p>Detecting irregularities will also increase the chances of prosecuting crimes. Earlier detection of irregularities will mean that future ongoing payments can be stopped at an earlier stage. The attractiveness of this type of crime can therefore be expected to decrease.</p>
<p>One important aspect of reduced criminality affecting the welfare system is the implications for other, more serious crime. There have been examples of the proceeds of welfare crime being used to finance serious organised crime and, in some cases, even terrorist activities. Our proposals reduce the opportunities to finance such serious crime, with positive effects for society at large.</p>
<p>We believe that our proposals will increase confidence in both the welfare state and social institutions.</p>
<h2>Lower state expenditure in the long term</h2>
<p>Although the proposals will initially involve increased costs, in the long term they are calculated to lead to lower state expenditure. The net effect depends on the results achieved by the Agency in terms of reduced irregular payments.</p>
<p>Irregular welfare payments have been estimated at approximately SEK 18 billion, equivalent to approximately 3% of total payments. Even though the estimates should be cautiously interpreted, irregular payments amount to a significant sum. If only a small proportion of these payments disappear, it will balance and justify the cost of the Agency.</p>
<p>The transaction account system largely involves a fixed cost, while to a large extent, other elements of the proposals can be adapted to the chosen level of ambition.</p>
<h2>Consequences for government agencies</h2>
<p>Many of the consequences for government agencies will be similar. One consequence for directly affected agencies is that IT solutions will need to be implemented for data transfer to the Payment Control Agency. These government agencies will also be affected by the cooperation built up with the Payment Control Agency. Intelligence regarding suspected irregularities gathered by the Payment Control Agency will be made available to the existing authorities. The proposals contribute to the quality of the control activities performed by the government agencies. In all likelihood, intelligence from the Payment Control Agency will lead to more reassessments and demands for repayment by the agencies in question.</p>
<h2>Consequences for municipalities and regions</h2>
<p>The proposals have no consequences for municipal self-governance, as at this stage it is not proposed to include municipalities and regions in the Agency’s activities. There is however a risk of passing on costs. If the detection and prevention of irregular state welfare payments is strengthened, it may lead those who abuse the system to target regional and municipal organisations.</p>
<p>The unemployment benefit funds shall provide information to the Payment Control Agency on a regular basis. The proposal therefore increases the reporting burden on unemployment benefit funds.</p>
<p>The unemployment benefit funds will receive regular notifications from the Payment Control Agency regarding suspected irregularities. This will provide documentation for use in the control activities conducted by the unemployment benefit funds.</p>
<h2>Consequences for businesses</h2>
<p>The proposal contributes to competition on equal terms. Serious businesses currently struggle to compete with companies whose business model is based on abusing the welfare system. Our proposals are specifically intended to make it more difficult for more serious schemes to defraud the welfare system.</p>
<p>Credits institutions will be faced with a somewhat increased reporting burden, as it is proposed that they be required to provide information for the Agency’s in-depth enquiries</p>
