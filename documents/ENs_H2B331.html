<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>The proposal’s background and reasons</h2>
<p>There is no specific regulation in Swedish law for the protection of employees who report or disclose wrongdoings in the workplace. As a consequence, different rules from different fields of law are applied. The law regulating employees’ reporting and disclosures of wrongdoings can be described as difficult and complex.</p>
<p>It is an important public interest that employees who observe serious wrongdoings report or disclose them. Through employees’ reporting or disclosures, wrongdoings can be exposed, corrected or eliminated. The public can also be informed about threats to the public interest, for example corruption, environmental damages, market abuse and neglect in the provision of health care services.</p>
<p>Studies show that employees who observe wrongdoings often do not report or disclose these wrongdoings. There are several reasons for this. One reason is that employees are afraid of retaliation. Another reason is that employees are uncertain about their legal protection. Yet another reason is that employees do not know how or to whom wrongdoings should be reported or disclosed.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s proposal is aimed at strengthening the protection for employees who blow the whistle through a clear and easily applicable regulation which gives the employee the right to damages in case he or she suffers from retaliation. The proposal is also aimed at strengthening the protection by shielding the employee’s identity, irrespective of whether the employee blows the whistle internally, to a government authority or publically providing information about wrongdoings. The proposal also includes a requirement for employers to facilitate the reporting of serious wrongdoings through internal routines or other measures.</p>
<p>The following principles have particularly guided the formulation of the proposal:  The regulation on the protection of employees who blow the whistle on serious wrongdoings needs to be strengthened;  The applicable rules on protection of whistleblowers should be clear and easy to apply. To that end, criteria for the protection should be kept to a minimum;  The strengthened protection should also acknowledge other legitimate interests, for example employers’ interest to avoid harm to their reputation. Thus, the criteria have to be weighted in such a manner that there is a reasonable balance between different interests;  The social partners should as far as possible be able to regulate the strengthened protection through collective agreements. The Swedish labour market model should thus be respected to the extent possible.</p>
<h2>The proposal in summary</h2>
<p>The Inquiry is proposing the following. Firstly, the inquiry proposes a new labour act on strengthened protection for employees who blow the whistle on serious wrongdoings in the employer’s organization.</p>
<p>Secondly, a new section is proposed in the Work Environment Act (1977:1160) which requires employers – in proportion to the organization’s needs – to either make sure that there are routines for internal reporting of serious wrongdoings or to take other measures to facilitate such reporting. Thirdly, the Inquiry proposes rules for the protection of the identity of employees who blow the whistle on serious wrongdoings.</p>
<h2>A new labour act on strengthened protection for whistleblowers</h2>
<p>The proposed labour act gives employees the right to damages if the employee suffers retaliation because of the fact that the employee has reported or disclosed serious wrongdoings in the employer’s organization. The act does not limit any protections an employee has according to other acts, constitutional law or the European Convention on Human Rights. The proposed act protects two types of whistleblowing: external and internal.</p>
<h2>External disclosures</h2>
<p>An external disclosure is protected when the employee publicizes information about serious wrongdoings or gives such information to a government authority if certain conditions are met.</p>
<p>Firstly, the nature of the disclosed information should concern serious wrongdoings. A serious wrongdoing is conduct which reasonably can be believed to constitute a crime with a prescribed imprisonment penalty. Serious wrongdoings are also breaches of fundamental human rights; breaches of public policy; corrupt conduct; threats to life, security and health; threats and damages to the environment; misuse of public funds; breaches of financial market regulation; breaches of an organization’s internal regulation; and more serious unethical conduct.</p>
<p>Secondly, the employee should as a general principle have reported the serious wrongdoings internally before disclosing them externally. Exceptions can be made if the employer has not taken appropriate measures in response to the internal reporting, or if the employee otherwise has justified reasons to disclose the information externally, for example if there is an emergency situation, if the wrongdoings are of particularly serious nature, if the employee has a specific reason to expect retaliation or if the employer is responsible for the wrongdoings.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the employee should have valid reasons to believe that the disclosed information is correct. Whether the employee has valid reasons to believe that the information is correct is determined objectively.</p>
<h2>Internal reporting</h2>
<p>The employee has also strengthened protection when reporting serious wrongdoings internally. Internal reporting is protected when the employee reports to the employer, to a representative of the employer or when the employee follows a reporting routine which has been prescribed by the employer. The employee is also protected if he or she reports serious wrongdoings to the employee’s trade union if the employer has a collective agreement with the employee’s trade union.</p>
<h2>Exceptions, diverging agreements, sanctions and the burden of proof</h2>
<p>The proposed act does not give employees strengthened protection in case the employee commits a crime by reporting or disclosing serious wrongdoings.</p>
<p>Agreements that limit the protection according to the act are void. The social partners on the labour market are however allowed to diverge from the act through collective agreements as long as the collective agreement is entered or approved by a central labour organization.</p>
<p>The proposed act protects employees against retaliation from the employer. Retaliation can be dismissals, transfers to another position or disciplinary actions. The employee is also protected against more informal sanctions in the course of employment, for example social ostracism and harassment.</p>
<p>An employer who retaliates against an employee in breach of the act must compensate the employee. The compensation includes damages for both economic losses and injuries. If the employee shows circumstances that give reason to believe that he or she has suffered retaliation, the employer has to establish that there was no retaliation.</p>
<h2>Requirement for employers to have internal routines or to take other measures to facilitate reporting</h2>
<p>A requirement is placed on all employers to take measures to facilitate internal reporting. The requirement is proportional to the risks of serious wrongdoings in each particular organization. Every employer must make a risk assessment and establish what measures should be taken. The requirement to have internal routines or to take other measures to facilitate reporting should be part of each organization’s systematic work for the labour environment. The</p>
<p>Swedish Work Environment Authority is proposed to exercise oversight over the implementation of the requirement.</p>
<h2>Protection of the identity of employees who report or disclose serious wrongdoings</h2>
<p>A new duty of confidentiality is proposed for persons who receive reports about serious wrongdoings in accordance with the employer’s internal routines. Persons who are covered by the duty of confidentiality are prohibited from disclosing the identity of the employee other than in certain cases, for example if there is a legal duty to disclose the identity of the employee or if the disclosure is necessary for the investigation of the wrongdoings.</p>
<p>A new secrecy section is also proposed to the Public Access to Information and Secrecy Act (2009:400). The secrecy section will prohibit government organs from disclosing the identity of those employees who make a protected disclose in accordance with the proposed act. A second secrecy section is also proposed to the Public Access to Information and Secrecy Act for the application of the proposed act in courts.</p>
