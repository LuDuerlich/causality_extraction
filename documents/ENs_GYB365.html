<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>The remit of the Qualification Requirements Inquiry</h2>
<p>On 2 April 2009, the Swedish Government appointed an inquiry chair with a remit to investigate a number of issues relating to the regulation of qualification requirements in health care and social services. The Inquiry was directed to: - assess whether additional professional groups should be regulated in the  health-care sector, - consider changes in the duties of opticians, - examine whether the system of special appointment to practise a profession in health care is appropriate, - present proposals leading to more nurses receiving specialist training, - review the provisions on restrictions on the right to take certain  health-care measures, - make it clearer to the general public what is regarded as health care and what is classified as  health-care-related activity, - present proposals on ways in which specialty training programmes for dentists should be regulated, - review the content and scope of training for dental hygienists and - examine and analyse the prospects for regulation of qualification requirements for certain tasks in the social services.</p>
<p>In presenting our proposals, we are asked to be mindful of high patient safety and the high level of trust among the public in both health care and the social services. Our proposals should also take account of the constitutional principle of freedom of trade. We are asked to base ourselves on the principles which today underpin qualification requirements and licence to practise, and our proposals should create good conditions for the application of specific skills which distinguish the various professional groups in the health-care sector in an effective and flexible way. Some parts of the remit require us to consider whether the present-day provisions are appropriate.</p>
<h2>Should further professional groups in the health-care sector be regulated?</h2>
<p>Provisions on licence to practise, exclusive right to practise a profession, protected title and protected specialist designation are contained in the Professional Activities in the Health and Medical Care Field Act (LYHS). With effect from 1 January 2011, these provisions are contained in the new Patient Safety Act. The principal function of licence to practise is to guarantee that staff have a certain level of knowledge and certain personal characteristics.</p>
<p>Patient safety is the overarching criterion in assessing which professional groups are to be regulated. Other criteria that may be of great significance are: - the content of the professional role – which should have a certain breadth and contain a certain degree of independence, - the training programme – which should be of high quality, well defined and lead to a particular profession and - international relations – including the EU rules Sweden has undertaken to apply on mutual recognition of formal qualifications for activity in the  health-care sector and the Nordic agreement on a common labour market for certain health-care staff.</p>
<p>It is not necessary for all the criteria to be met for a professional group to be granted licence to practise. How much should be required for a professional group to be eligible for a licence to practise has to be decided by striking a balance. Patient safety overrides other criteria. There may be less need for a licence to practise if the profession is only practised in public employment than if there are opportunities to undertake the activity privately. Under our terms of reference, we are asked to avoid creating a system of duplicate licences to practice.</p>
<p>We are free to propose changes to the principles which today dictate which professional groups are to be regulated. Our assessment is, however, that the present-day principles are well established and appropriate. We therefore do not propose any changes.</p>
<p>In our view it is reasonable that a licence to practise should primarily be considered for professional groups who have qualifications from Swedish higher education. The reason for this is that their education is consequently covered by the National Agency for Higher Education’s regular review and evaluation and that under the Higher Education Act it has to be founded on a scientific basis and proven experience.</p>
<p>We wish to emphasise the regulation of a profession cannot replace the responsibility of the health-care provider to plan, direct and check activity. There is a need for systematic work on patient safety, treatment based on science and proven experience, as well as competent and skilled practitioners to achieve good patient safety.</p>
<p>The following groups have expressed a wish for regulation of their profession in written communications and at meetings: cytodiagnosticians, social workers in the health-care sector, medical massage therapists, chiropodists, podiatrists, orthoptists, osteopaths, perfusionists, dental technicians and urotherapists.</p>
<h2>Our proposals:</h2>
<p>Cytodiagnosticians</p>
<p>The principal task of cytodiagnosticians is to use microscopy to diagnose whether there are cell changes in smears from patients. It is most common to diagnose smears in order to identify precursor stages of cervical cancer. This professional group receives thorough higher education and performs highly skilled tasks. Most are qualified as biomedical analysts and have received supplementary training in diagnostic cytology. This means that those who work as cytodiagnosticians, with a few exceptions, are licensed to practise as biomedical analysts. Cytodiagnosticians have a relatively narrow professional role with a limited number of tasks. They are principally employed in laboratories in the public health service, and as healthcare staff are supervised by the National Board of Health and Welfare. If a special licence to practise was introduced for this professional group, it would lead to duplicate licences to practise. We therefore do not consider the conditions for proposing a licence to practise for cytodiagnosticians to be met.</p>
<p>Social workers in the health-care sector</p>
<p>Social workers in the health-care sector operate on the basis of a psychological and social perspective and work in many different areas of health care. These social workers have an independent professional role with clear responsibility for patients. In providing health care, they are under the supervision of the National Board of Health and Welfare. Those who act as social workers hold a Bachelor of Science degree in social work and public administration, supplemented by various advanced training courses. There is no separate training intended specifically for the profession of social worker in the health-care sector. The Bachelor of Science degree in social work and public administration is a programme which is intended to meet the need for general skills in social work throughout the social field. If a licence to practise for social workers in the healthcare sector was introduced, it would have to be differentiated from others who hold the Bachelor of Science degree in social work and public administration. Licence to practise would therefore need to be linked to work tasks rather than to the training received. We therefore do not propose that licence to practise should be introduced for social workers in the health-care sector.</p>
<p>Chiropodists and podiatrists</p>
<p>Both these professional groups work in the area of foot care. Chiropodists are primarily private practitioners. Training in chiropody has been arranged for a few years in the form of qualified professional training (KY). The type of training does not satisfy the requirements for licence to practice which we have established. It is also our impression that among chiropodists currently active there is a wide variety of educational backgrounds, where the level of skill is in large part the result of the chiropodist’s own development efforts and continuing professional education through various private courses.</p>
<p>Podiatrists are a limited professional group, whose training in Sweden is being phased out. The last annual intakes will graduate in 2011. There will then be no Swedish higher education for podiatrists. We therefore do not make any proposals for the regulation of chiropodists and podiatrists.</p>
<p>Medical massage therapists</p>
<p>Medical massage therapists use massage and muscle stretching for well-being and preventive purposes and for the treatment of specific injuries and complaints in the locomotor system. The vast majority of them work as private practitioners. Our assessment is that their training does not fulfil the requirements for a licence to practise. We therefore do not make any such proposal.</p>
<p>Orthoptists</p>
<p>Orthoptists examine, diagnose and treat unilateral visual impairments. They mainly work at eye clinics in hospitals. Orthoptists have a background of training in nursing, and the majority of them are trained ophthalmic nurses. They then undergo supplementary training specialising in orthoptics. Introducing a licence to practice for orthoptists would therefore mean that they have duplicate licenses to practise. We therefore do not make any proposal for a licence to practise for this professional group.</p>
<p>There is no specialised programme today for nurses wishing to specialise in orthoptics. In Chapter 12 we argue that specialist nurse training should be made more flexible. Within the framework of such a more flexible system it might be possible for orthoptists to gain protected specialist designation.</p>
<p>Osteopaths</p>
<p>Osteopathy is a form of treatment based on the body being a unit, all the parts of which are related and dependent on one another. The most important task for an osteopath is to find the cause of what is preventing the body from healing itself. Osteopaths in principle work exclusively as private practitioners outside the health service. The two osteopath training programmes held in Sweden are not higher education programmes under the Higher Education Act. We therefore do not propose a licence to practise for this professional group.</p>
<p>Perfusionists</p>
<p>The principal task of perfusionists is to control the heart-lung machine in connection with heart surgery. They work almost exclusively as employees in the public health service and not as private practitioners. They are therefore covered by National Board of Health and Welfare supervision. There is no Swedish higher education programme for perfusionists at present. We therefore do not propose a licence to practise for this professional group.</p>
<p>Dental technicians</p>
<p>Dental technicians design and make individually fitted replacements for lost teeth. They do fulfil the requirements for licence to practise with regard to education. They additionally carry out advanced tasks and to an ever increasing degree have contact with patients. In our view it is, however, the dentist who is responsible for the treatment as a whole, even though it is the dental technician who makes the replacements for lost teeth. Our impression is that dental technicians primarily work with the material and that the contacts with patients that take place mostly relate to aesthetic issues.</p>
<p>The replacements made by dental technicians are covered by the legislation on medical devices. This means that there are detailed provisions which in various ways regulate the activity and which among other things contain requirements on monitoring how the devices work in practical use. Dental technicians therefore have to register their activity with the Medical Products Agency, which also supervises this activity. Taking all aspects into consideration, we therefore do not make any proposal for a licence to practise for dental technicians.</p>
<p>Urotherapists</p>
<p>Urotherapists investigate and treat people with urinary leakage or other bladder disorders. At present they are nurses, midwives, physiotherapists or doctors with a licence to practise who have received advanced training in urotherapy. As we are asked not to create duplicate licences to practise, we do not make any proposal on regulation for this professional group.</p>
<h2>Further regulation of qualifications for professional groups with licence to practise</h2>
<p>A number of professional groups which have a licence to practise have expressed a wish for further regulation of qualification requirements. The Swedish Association for Diabetes Specialist Nurses wishes to be granted a protected title. The Swedish Association of Occupational Therapists would like 12 months of full-time practical experience to be a requirement for licence to practise as an occupational therapist. The same request has been made by the Swedish Association of Audiologists with regard to audiologists. The Swedish Association of Registered Physiotherapists wishes to have a specialist training programme, and the Swedish Psychological Association considers there to be an urgent need for state regulation of the specialist skills of psychologists to be investigated more closely. The Association also wants psychologists to have exclusive right to practise their profession. The Swedish Association of Registered Physiotherapists has argued that the Swedish title sjukgymnast  should be replaced by fysioterapeut . The Government has also forwarded a request form the Orthopaedic Sector Council for an amendment to the provisions concerning licence to practise as an orthopaedic engineer.</p>
<p>Nurses in diabetic care</p>
<p>In our view, it should be possible for diabetes nurses to be regarded as nurses with specialist training. If this training becomes more flexible, it may be possible for diabetes nurses to gain a protected specialist title (see Chapter 12). Our assessment is that a protected title for diabetes nurses should not be introduced at present.</p>
<p>Practical experience – a requirement for licence to practise?</p>
<p>We consider that the practical experience required for licence to practise should form part of the training and that passing an examination should be the criterion that has to be met for a licence to practise to be issued. The employer would then be responsible for employees having the skills required. An important aspect of this responsibility is to give new employees the induction necessary to carry out the work in a way that is satisfactory and safe for patients. We therefore do not consider that practical experience should be a requirement for licence to practise for occupational therapists or audiologists.</p>
<p>Should more groups have a protected specialist title and a regulated specialist scheme?</p>
<p>There are specialist schemes today for physiotherapists and psychologists which are organised by the Swedish Association of Registered Physiotherapists and the Swedish Psychological Association. It is also possible for physiotherapists and psychologists with a licence to practice to state that they have continuing professional education and specialist training. The training on which licence to practise for these groups is based is also relatively extensive and of good quality. We do not consider there to be reason, from the point of view of patient safety, to introduce a regulated specialist scheme and protected specialist title for these two professional groups.</p>
<p>Should psychologists have exclusive right to practise their profession?</p>
<p>For a professional group to have exclusive right to practise a particular profession, the need to improve patient safety must be so great that freedom of trade should be restricted. We do not consider there to be reason to introduce such an exclusive right for any additional group. Such an exclusive right for psychologists would also cause difficulties with regard to defining what tasks would then be covered by the exclusive right.</p>
<p>Should the Swedish title of physiotherapist be changed from sjukgymnast  to fysioterapeut ?</p>
<p>Fysioterapeut  is a title which today is used both by those who treat people and those who treat animals, for example horses and dogs. Internationally the term fysioterapeut  is equivalent to sjukgymnast . Sjukgymnast  today is a title which is used to significantly more people than the title fysioterapeut . A problem that many people consider to exist with regard to protected titles is that the title of therapist is often confused. We consider this risk of confusion to be a strong argument for not replacing the title sjukgymnast  with fysioterapeut . Such a change would also mean that the title sjukgymnast , after a transitional period, could be used by anyone. In view of how well established the title is, this would make it more difficult for patients/consumers to judge who is a health-care professional and who is not.</p>
<p>What training provides entitlement to a licence to practise as an orthopaedic engineer?</p>
<p>Licence to practice for orthopaedic engineers was introduced in 2006. To avoid excluding those who have followed older training programmes, it was decided that it should also be possible for these training programmes to provide the basis for a licence to practise for this professional group. It is also possible for the National Board of Health and Welfare, in exceptional cases, to grant a licence to practise to those who have demonstrated satisfactory skills other than by gaining a degree. This possibility exists with regard to all professions with licence to practise. The rules on exemptions are, for obvious reasons, most relevant when a licence to practise is introduced. Nearly everyone who has followed an older training programme to become an orthopaedic engineer should now have had time to apply for a licence to practise. Nor have we found that orthopaedic engineers, regardless of educational background, have been the subject of action by the National Board of Health and Welfare or the Medical Responsibility Board (HSAN) to any major extent. We therefore do not consider there to be grounds for changing the requirements for licence to practise as an orthopaedic engineer.</p>
<h2>Review of the duties of opticians</h2>
<p>We do not judge there to be a need to alter the duties of opticians in the health-care system – with one exception. We propose that opticians be allowed to use what are known as diagnostic drops. The use of such drops leads to better quality in sight tests. It provides a basis for the early detection of severe visual defects and suspected pathological changes in the eye. There are two groups of patients who can be expected to benefit most from the use of diagnostic drops. The first of these is children over the age of eight years, as some visual defects in this group can be detected significantly more reliably if drops are allowed to be used. The other group is the older part of the population, as it is important that eye diseases such as glaucoma are detected at an early stage.</p>
<p>If opticians are allowed to use diagnostic drops, the number of incorrect referrals will also decrease. The risks associated with the drops are small, but only opticians who have received training in using such drops should be authorised to prescribe them. Karolinska Institutet has organised continuing professional education courses in the use of diagnostic drops since the autumn of 2008. As these drops are only to be used in certain sight tests, authorisation should be limited so that it only relates to requesting those diagnostic medicines which are needed in such tests. The National Board of Health and Welfare and the Medical Products Agency should be the authorities which issue regulations on authorisation for opticians to use medicines.</p>
<p>During our inquiry, representatives of the optician industry expressed a wish for the provisions on who is allowed to supply contact lenses to be tightened. When the new Patient Safety Act comes into effect on 1 January 2011, the ban on people other than health-care professionals supplying contact lenses ceases to apply. We therefore do not consider this issue in our report.</p>
<p>• Opticians who meet certain skills requirements should be authorised to use diagnostic drops.</p>
<p>• The National Board of Health and Welfare and the Medical Products Agency should be the authorities which issue regulations on authorisation for opticians to prescribe medicines.</p>
<h2>Special appointment to practise a profession in the health-care sector</h2>
<p>We have been asked to consider whether the present-day system of special appointments to practise a profession in the health-care sector is appropriate. It is possible at present for the county councils to employ doctors who do not have a licence to practise, without applying for special appointment for the individual, in the following cases: - Doctors for  pre-registration training, which is a condition for obtaining licence to practise. - Locum tenens doctors, if the person employed has a medical degree from Sweden or another Nordic country or has been trained abroad and has obtained a decision on a  pre-registration training post from the National Board of Health and Welfare. - Doctors who have received training abroad and who have to take a probationary post for six months. - Medical students who have completed studies up to and including the ninth semester with approved courses, They may work as locum tenens doctors in the health service under supervision with the exception of posts in primary care.</p>
<p>The county councils have been granted this option to facilitate the administration of employment. Every year around 2 200 Bachelors of Medicine ( medicine kandidater ) are employed as pre-registration doctors. The number of locum tenens doctors is estimated at around 1 000 per year.</p>
<p>A problem to which attention was drawn as long ago as 2001 by the then Swedish Federation of County Councils is that it is not possible for those who operate private health care to employ doctors without licence to practise for pre-registration posts, locum tenens posts and probationary posts. This is evident from communication which the Government has forwarded to us. Since the Swedish Federation of County Councils drew attention to this just under 10 years ago, the number of private health-care practitioners has increased substantially. However, it is possible for individuals to apply for special appointment by the National Board of Health and Welfare.</p>
<p>When someone receives a special appointment to practise a profession in the health-care sector, this should be scrutinised just as carefully as when a licence to practise is granted. From 1 January 2011, the National Board of Health and Welfare will have access to information from the Criminal Records Registry on certain offences which have led to the imposition of sanctions other than fines. The purpose of this is to allow applications for a licence to practise to be assessed and to assist the Board in its supervisory activity with regard to health-care professionals. In our view, this direct access should also apply to the Board's assessment of applications for special appointment. We also consider that the county councils should have the right to request extracts from the Criminal Records Registry to allow an assessment to be made of whether a person should be granted a special appointment for a pre-registration post or a locum tenens post. There is a need to review the regulations which enable the county councils to employ doctors without a licence to practise.</p>
<p>• The  present-day system of special appointment is appropriate and meets the need to enable doctors without a licence to practise to work in the health-care sector under certain circumstances. It has not been evident during our work that these special appointments cause any problems or pose any danger to patient safety.</p>
<p>• In dealing with such special appointments to practise a profession, county councils and the National Board of Health and Welfare should have access to information on what offences have led to the imposition of a sanction other than fines.</p>
<p>• The National Board of Health and Welfare should review the regulations which enable the county councils in certain cases to issue special appointments to practise the medical profession.</p>
<h2>Specialist nurses</h2>
<p>Our remit has been to conduct a broad inquiry into why too few specialist nurses are trained in relation to the needs of the healthcare sector and to present proposals for ways in which more can be trained.</p>
<p>The term specialist nurse is generally used to mean a nurse who has obtained a degree as a specialist nurse. There are degrees at present in 11 specialties: 1. anaesthetic care 2. intensive care 3. operative care 4. outpatient care 5. surgical care 6. medical care 7. oncological care 8. health care for children and adolescents 9. psychiatric care 10. care of the elderly 11. district nursing</p>
<p>All these training programmes provide 60 university credits, with the exception of the district nursing specialisation, which provides 75 credits. Licence to practise as a nurse is required for qualification to specialist training, and the student has to have completed an inservice part of the training programme (VFU) as well as independent work in order to be able to gain the degree. Anyone who has completed the specialist nurse training programme is entitled to the protected specialist title. Central government is responsible for the specialist nurse training programme and funds it, including the inservice element which takes place in particular in care organised by county councils or municipalities.</p>
<p>Nurses with a licence to practise can also receive continuing professional education in ways other than by obtaining a specialist nursing degree. Many nurses choose to make a detailed study of ophthalmic care, diabetes care, pain, asthma, allergy, diabetes, rheumatism etc. However, this type of continuing professional education does not lead to a specialist nursing qualification and does not give entitlement to use of a protected title. Both a degree in specialist nursing and other continuing professional education of nurses can take the form of commissioned training, which means that a county council or a municipality orders a training programme from an institute of higher education and pays for it.</p>
<h2>What is the demand for and supply of specialist nurses?</h2>
<p>It is not possible to state in absolute figures how large the gap is between the supply of specialist nurses and the need for this type of skill in the health service. The need depends on a number of relative factors, such as what targets different care units have with regard to manning levels. Nor is there any regulation of how many of the nurses in an organisation must have specialist training. According to the National Board of Health and Welfare Annual report NPS 2010 , one in every two nurses today has specialist training. It is also apparent that the county councils consider it difficult to recruit specialist nurses, particularly in the operative, psychiatric, intensive care and anaesthetic fields.</p>
<h2>Why are too few specialist nurses being trained?</h2>
<p>There is no single reason why a sufficient number of specialist nurses are not being trained. Views also differ on what needs to be done for more people to train. It is stressed that there is no demand for specialist nurses in the health-care sector and that they do not receive higher pay or new duties. If the training does not lead to changes with regard to duties, responsibilities, pay etc., it is reasonable to assume that this has an impact on the level of interest in undergoing further training.</p>
<p>In the same way, the possibility of training in paid employment would probably have an impact on the level of interest among nurses in continuing professional education. Pay and other terms of employment are, however, regulated between the employers and unions. As the specialist training of nurses is a state higher-education programme, the question of whether the training can be provided within paid employment must also be decided by the employer and the individual nurse.</p>
<p>In addition, it is the responsibility of the health-care provider to direct and distribute the work so that different duties are performed by staff with the right skills. A requirement for a certain proportion of nurses in a care unit to have specialist training would signify a special solution which is not compatible with the regulations in general. The obligation of the healthcare provider to ensure that those who work in the organisation have the right skills for their duties is also highlighted in the Government bill Patient Safety and Supervision  (2009/10:210) for a new Patient Safety Act, which comes into force on 1 January 2011. The same requirements to be met by the health-care provider are contained in the National Board of Health and Welfare Regulations (SOSFS 2005:12) on management systems for quality and patient safety in health care.</p>
<p>The level of interest among nurses in undergoing specialist training probably also depends on the range of training programmes available and where in the country they are held. Given the present-day rules on higher education institutions, there are extremely limited prospects of meaningfully influencing the training provision in these institutions. They determine where in the country the training takes place, whether the training is provided on a full-time or part-time basis, whether it is arranged on the Internet and so on.</p>
<p>Some people are of the opinion that the specialist training of nurses ought to be formulated in the same way as the specialty training programmes for doctors. This would, however, mean that the training of specialist nurses becomes an in-service specialisation programme and no longer a higher-education training programme. It would consequently become more difficult for specialist nurses to be admitted to training at postgraduate level. This ought therefore to be investigated in a wider context, where the in-service specialisation programmes or specialist training programmes of the professions are reviewed at the same time.</p>
<p>The most important question to ask in order to discover why too few specialist nurses are being trained is: Do the 11 specialties actually meet the needs of the care sector today and in the future? The principal sign that this is not the case is that health-care providers buy commissioned training in areas other than the 11 with specialist training. In our view the training therefore needs to become more flexible, with institutions of higher education being allowed to organise training programmes within the specialisms which are in demand in the health-care sector. Nurses who undergo specialist training will consequently also be in demand in the care sector, while more flexible training can more easily track the development of knowledge in health care.</p>
<p>A problem on which everyone concerned is agreed is that there are shortcomings in the dialogue and collaboration between institutions of higher education and health-care providers. The healthcare providers cannot describe their need for specialist nurses, and the specialist training programmes are not designed in accordance with the needs of the health-care sector. Cooperation on in-service training (VFU) must also improve.</p>
<p>The National Agency for Higher Education has conducted a review of specialist nurse training, which was presented in the report</p>
<p>Specialist training of nurses – what kind of qualification? (2010:5R) in May 2010. The proposals presented in the report, together with our analysis, ought to be able to provide a basis for continued discussion of the issue of the design of training for specialist nurses. If a new, more flexible training programme is introduced, it is important that the provisions on protected title for specialist nurses are reviewed. In our view there should continue in the future to be a protected specialist title for specialist nurses, which is linked to the field within which they have obtained their specialism.</p>
<h2>Our proposal:</h2>
<p>• The National Agency for Higher Education should be instructed, in cooperation with the National Board of Health and Welfare and in consultation with the Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions, to investigate and propose forms of cooperation between the  health-care sector and the institutions of higher education and mutually between the institutions of higher education with regard to the training of specialist nurses.</p>
<h2>Activity related to the health-care sector</h2>
<p>We have been asked to present proposals which make it clearer to the general public what is and is not counted as part of health care. According to our terms of reference there is a risk of confusion and of misleading information in the type of activity usually known as alternative and complementary medicine (ACM). A risk of confusion often arises when practitioners of various types of treatments use titles and descriptions in their marketing of methods which allude to traditional health care.</p>
<p>There is no clear answer regarding what ACM is. A description often used is that employed by the Cochrane Collaboration. This organisation describes the area of alternative medicine as all the forms of health care that exist outside the politically dominated health-care sector in a particular society in or in a particular culture during a particular historical period.</p>
<p>It is not possible to give a precise figure for the number of people employed in alternative forms of therapy in Sweden, but in 2007 just over 25 500 people were working in the sectors which encompass alternative forms of treatment. There are also a number of organisations and associations which organise practitioners of various alternative therapies in Sweden.</p>
<p>Register of alternative therapists</p>
<p>To make it easier for people to make conscious choices on what form of care and treatment they wish to receive, we propose that a register should be established for those who practise alternative therapies and who are not health-care professionals with a licence to practise. Registration would, however, be conditional on the practitioner being a member of a professional organisation in the area of ACM. These organisations should also be included in the register. Registration should be voluntary. A mandatory register might lead to incorrect expectations that central government in some way vouches for the registered practitioners and the therapies they employ.</p>
<p>Those professional organisations wishing to be included in the register should be non-profit organisations whose principal purpose is to organise professional practitioners of alternative therapies. The professional organisation should also be of a certain size. A suitable basis might be for the organisation to have at least 30 members. Professional organisations play an important role through the knowledge gathered in them and the close cooperation that often takes place with training coordinators. To be included in the register, the organisation must have statutes enabling it to receive complaints, to exclude members and to set requirements for particular training for its members. Practitioners of alternative methods of treatment must have basic general medical knowledge of the human body and its various organs, pathology and regulations in the field of health care. The principal purpose of requiring such basic knowledge is that the practitioner has to know whether he or she should take on a patient or refer the patient to the health-care sector. The professional organisation also has to have rules on marketing and requirements and require its members to hold insurance which, among other things, compensates for any injuries caused by treatment. Registration should be financed by an annual fee paid by the members of the register.</p>
<p>We propose that the Swedish Consumer Agency should administer the register and approve those organisations which fulfil the requirements to be allowed to take part. The Swedish Consumer Agency is the administrative authority for consumer issues and is responsible for the rules on consumer protection being respected and consumers having access to information which enables them to make active choices and for strengthening the position of consumers in the market. Under the Marketing Act, traders must not make false claims about their own qualifications. In a recent review of the Consumer Services Act, it was proposed that a new chapter should be introduced on the treatment and care of people. In our view, a register which makes it possible for consumers to make conscious choices among practitioners of alternative therapy methods is a good match for the Agency’s area of responsibility.</p>
<p>Alternative therapies are also used in the health service and supplement or are fully integrated into established health care. They are also covered by the rules governing the organisation, which means that patient safety is maintained. The register we propose should only contain practitioners of alternative therapies who are not health-care professionals with a licence to practise. The reason for this is to further clarify the difference. It should, however, be possible for health-care professionals to switch between working in traditional health care and operating outside the health service as practitioners of alternative therapies. This creates a need for staff with a licence to practise to cede their licence to practise, but also be able to regain it.</p>
<p>The register must be readily accessible. This means that it must be on the Internet. An information portal containing objective and scientific information about the various therapies offered should also be linked to the register. A national information campaign should be conducted at the time when the register is introduced to make it generally known.</p>
<h2>Our proposals:</h2>
<p>• A register should be established for those who practise alternative therapies and who are not  health-care professionals with a licence to practise. Anyone wishing to register must be a member of a professional organisation in the area of ACM which has been approved for inclusion in the register.</p>
<p>• The Swedish Consumer Agency should administer the register.</p>
<p>• A national information campaign should be conducted when the register is introduced.</p>
<h2>Restrictions on the right to take certain measures</h2>
<p>There is no general ban on undertaking professional activity in the area of health care. However, the opportunities to do so are limited by the regulation that exists on authority to practise professions in the health-care sector, provisions on exclusive right to practise professions, protected titles, skills as a European doctor and specialist skills.</p>
<p>The principal rule is thus that it has to be permitted for anyone to operate in the area of health care. Activity related to health care is currently only regulated through the restrictions contains in the Professional Activities in the Health and Medical Care Field Act (1998:31, LYHS). It is stipulated there that anyone who is not a health-care professional must not: - treat infections diseases which are notifiable under the Communicable Diseases Act, - treat cancer and other malignant tumours, diabetes, epilepsy or - pathological conditions in connection with pregnancy or childbirth, - examine or treat under general or local anaesthetic, by injection or under hypnosis, - use radiological methods, - supply written advice or instructions for treatment without personal examination, - try out or supply contact lenses or - treat children below the age of 8 years.</p>
<p>The Riksdag has adopted a resolution to remove the ban on selling contact lenses with effect from 1 January 2011. The new Patient Safety Act also comes into effect on that date. The provisions of the Professional Activities in the Health Medical Care Field Act will then also be contained in this Act.</p>
<p>A wish has been expressed at the meetings and hearings we have held and through written communications we have studied for changes in the restrictions which exist at present with regard to the use of alternative methods of treatment. The wishes expressed are for the ban on treating children below the age of eight years to be removed, alternatively for the age limit to be raised to 15 or 18 years, for pregnant women to be allowed to receive alternative therapy and for mental diseases and treatment by psychotherapy to be included in the enumeration of diseases which must not be treated.</p>
<p>The argument behind prohibiting treatment of children below the age of 8 years is that while an adult has the option of discontinuing treatment if it leads to an exacerbation or does not produce any results, children are dependent on the assessment of their parents and the therapist. When children start school they undergo regular medical checks, which should enable it to be discovered whether they are receiving incorrect or harmful treatment.</p>
<p>In September 2007, Sweden presented a report on efforts made by the Government and government agencies in the past five years to put the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child into practice. On 12 June 2009 the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child presented its conclusions after examining the report. The Commission expressed concern that Sweden prohibits the use of ACM for examination, treatment and care of children below the age of eight years and for pregnant women and women during childbirth. Sweden is one of the few countries not to permit treatment of children below the age of eight years. This must, however, be viewed in connection with the fact that there are a large number of countries (19 in Central and Southern Europe) where it is totally prohibited for anyone other than health-care professionals to give such care and treatment.</p>
<p>With regard to the treatment of pregnant women, our view is that there are already ways today of treating certain less serious complaints which may be related to pregnancy.</p>
<p>The risks of people with mental diseases being treated outside the health-care sector have been discussed in many contexts. However, there are no studies showing which methods are harmful or which conditions are associated with risk in treatment by alternative methods. This also makes it very difficult to indicate and specify which mental diseases would be covered by a ban on treatment. The same applies to the use of psychotherapy. It has now become apparent during our work that such treatment do not pose particularly significant risks. It is also difficult to specify which methods would be prohibited. There is a ban at present on using protected titles in marketing in a way that incorrectly gives the impression that the activity is performed by someone who has a licence to practise. This ban provides some protection for those who seek help with mental problems and wish to receive psychotherapy.</p>
<p>In the framework of our inquiry, we have not had an opportunity to analyse the need to add new somatic diseases for which treatment is banned or to remove any of the rules which at present limit the options for treatment. Such a review also requires the assistance of medical and other expertise.</p>
<p>• The National Board of Health and Welfare should be tasked with reviewing which somatic diseases should be subject to a ban on treatment, whether the age limit for children should be amended and the options for treating pregnant women.</p>
<h2>Need for supervision of alternative and complementary medicine</h2>
<p>The National Board of Health and Welfare is responsible at present for supervision of certain activities, including those related to health care. If anyone is convicted of an infringement of the rules limiting the options for care and treatment, the National Board of Health and Welfare may prohibit him or her from undertaking such activities for a certain period, or permanently. The Board also monitors whether anyone who is not authorised to do so uses protected titles or titles which may be confused with such protected titles. Supervision of activity related to health and medical care is otherwise exercised within the framework of general consumer legislation. We do not propose any strengthening of supervision in the area concerned.</p>
<h2>Protected titles</h2>
<p>Under our terms of reference, we have been asked to review the provisions relating to protected titles, as there may be a risk of these being used in a misleading manner in activity related to health care. A protected title may only be used by the person who has a licence to practise. Nor may anyone who does not hold a licence to practise use a title which may be confused with a protected title. The marketing of health-care services and related activity is only regulated today by the Marketing Act. Incorrectly claiming that a product or service is capable of curing diseases, functional impairments or deformities always represents improper marketing. The Act in itself provides scope for taking action against marketing which is misleading in relation to the trader's qualifications. With regard to how important it is from the point of view of patient safety that the person seeking care is not misled about the practitioner’s skills, we propose that the protection of titles should be expanded so that it also applies to the marketing of activity. As the National Board of Health and Welfare at present is responsible for supervision of the use of protected titles, we also consider that such a ban on marketing should come under the Board's supervision.</p>
<p>• Protection of titles should be expanded so that it also applies to the marketing of activity.</p>
<p>• The National Board of Health and Welfare should be responsible for supervision.</p>
<h2>Combined legislation</h2>
<p>The Professional Activities in the Health and Medical Field Act (LYHS) contains provisions both on health-care professionals and on what restrictions apply to those who practise alternative and complementary medicine. In our view, a combined law on alternative therapies would contribute to clarifying what is regarded as health care and what is not.</p>
<h2>Our proposal:</h2>
<p>• The provisions on what restrictions apply to those who practise alternative and complementary medicine should be transferred from the Professional Activities in the Health and Medical Field Act to separate piece of legislation which also contains the rules on the register which we propose.</p>
<h2>Specialist training programmes for dentists</h2>
<p>We have been asked to investigate and present proposals on how specialist training programmes for dentists should be regulated. The specialist training programmes are continuing professional education which takes place during employment. This training has to be undertaken at a clinic approved by the National Board of Health and Welfare. There are eight specialties at present: - paediatric dentistry (dental care of children and adolescents) - orthodontics (development and growth of the face, jaws and dentition) - periodontology (diseases and defects in the tissues surrounding the attachment of the tooth to the jawbone) - oral surgery (diseases and defects of the oral cavity, jaws, face and adjacent areas) - endodontics (pathological processes in the pulp of the tooth) - oral prosthetics (deformities and tissue loss in the jaws and face) - odontological radiology  (X-ray examinations of teeth, jaw and adjacent areas in the face including mandibular joints) - bite physiology (functional impairments in the mandibular system).</p>
<p>The number of specialities vary between EU Member States. Some countries do not have any specialties at all, while others have a relatively large number. Sweden, with its eight specialties, belongs to the latter category. In several of those countries which have few or no specialties dentists do, however, undergo several years of training programmes after their basic training and in practice operate as specialists. Only two specialties – orthodontics and oral surgery – can lead to automatic recognition of the professional qualification in the EU. Recognition for the other six specialties that exist in Sweden can be obtained under what is known as the general scheme.</p>
<p>Demand for dental care is affected by a number of factors such as the need of the population for dental care, availability of staff, support for dental care, national guidelines and so on. Dental health has improved dramatically in recent decades, particularly among children and adolescents. However, dental health does not automatically lead to lower demand for dental care. The number of children and adolescents with a great need for care has not decreased. An increased number elderly people with serious diseases and impaired general condition also makes increased demands, as does the fact that many elderly people retain their own teeth, supplemented by various types of implants.</p>
<p>We consider there to be a need for collective responsibility for specialist registrar training of dentists to enable efforts made to be continuously followed up and for changes to be made to the speciality training necessitated by developments in dental health. Responsibility should rest with a government agency. The National Board of Health and Welfare is at present responsible for the regulations and general guidelines on what knowledge, skills and approaches are to apply to each area of specialist expertise. This agency is also tasked with drawing up national guidelines for adult dental care, devising indicators by which to analyse and follow up the quality of dental care, taking responsibility for the dental health register which is to be used to monitor how dental care develops, prescribing how duties may be delegated in dental care and compiling and disseminating scientifically based knowledge on the properties and use of dental materials. In addition, the National Board of Health and Welfare is the competent authority under the Professional Qualifications Directive and monitors dental care issues in the initial work currently in progress in the 2012 review of the Directive by the European Commission. This, taken together, makes the Board well suited to also issuing regulations on the establishment and designation of the specialty training of dentists.</p>
<p>The National Board of Health and Welfare has been responsible for the establishment and designation of the specialist skills of doctors since 2010. A national council has been established to assist the Board. We propose that this national council should be expanded to also include skills in the area of dental care. The council should be appointed by the Government. Our hope is that a joint council can lead to the possibility of efficiency gains in administration and to allowing lessons to be drawn between the professions during the continuous monitoring of the development of specialty training.</p>
<p>When the council considers issues concerning the specialty training of dentists, it should consist of one chair and five members. The members should be appointed on the proposal of the National Board of Health and Welfare, representatives of the dental profession, the Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions and the National Agency for Higher Education.</p>
<p>The regulations and general guidelines on the specialist training programme for dentists need to be reviewed. In this review, it is important to take account of the changes in fields of work and opportunities for cooperation in the dental care teams that may be a consequence of the reduced number of dentists and the increased number of dental hygienists, and of the strengthening of the training of dental nurses which has taken place. Mobility within the EU, and to and from countries outside the EU, may also have an impact. If the review leads to requirements for mandatory courses in specialist skills to be included in the specialist training programme, consideration should be given to whether these should be funded by central government, as happens at present in the specialist training of doctors.</p>
<p>Responsibility for providing places for the specialty training programme for dentists has been understood to rest with the county councils. The county councils have fulfilled this responsibility. We propose that a provision be introduced into the Dental Care Act stating that the county councils are obliged to provide places for the specialty training programme for dentists to an extent equivalent to the planned future need for dentists with specialist skills in clinical work.</p>
<p>A wish has been expressed at meetings and hearings that the specialist training programme for dentists should be a university programme and that the training should be funded by central government. The specialist training of both doctors and dentists was deregulated as long ago as 1992. This deregulation has meant the abolition of detailed control of specialty training. In our view, the arguments that lay behind this deregulation should continue to apply, and the same system should be applied to doctors as for dentists.</p>
<h2>Our proposals:</h2>
<p>• The National Board of Health and Welfare should be tasked with issuing regulations on the establishment and designation of the specialty training programme for dentists.</p>
<p>• The national council for the specialty training of doctors, which is located at the National Board of Health and Welfare, should be expanded and tasked with also assisting the Board on the specialty training programme for dentists.</p>
<p>• The National Board of Health and Welfare should conduct a review of the descriptions of goals for training and of the regulations and general guidelines on the specialty training programme for dentists.</p>
<p>• A provision should be introduced into the Dental Care Act on the obligation of county councils to provide places for the specialty training programme for dentists.</p>
<p>• The specialty training programme for dentists should continue in future to be  in-service training.</p>
<p>• The question of whether this  in-service training should be a university-based training programme should be investigated in a wider context, with the specialty training programme or specialist training of several professions being examined simultaneously.</p>
<h2>Training of dental hygienists</h2>
<p>We have been asked to investigate the content and scope of the dental hygienist training programme.</p>
<p>Licence to practise for dental hygienists was introduced in 1991. Two years of studies in higher education leading to a professional qualification are required to obtain a licence to practise. The profession of dental hygienist is the only one among 21 professions subject to licence to practise in health and medical care to have a twoyear programme of training. The dental hygienist training programme is now available at eight institutions of higher education, all of which offer a third, elective year. Of those who study to become a dental hygienist, 58 per cent at present opt for a third year. During the third year, the students receive expanded training in the areas of paediatric and adolescent dental care, dental care of the elderly, dental care for groups with diseases affecting oral health, scientific methodology, cooperation in dental-care teams etc.</p>
<p>The supply of dental hygienists is good and is expected to increase by 47 per cent by 2023. Most projections also predict that the demand for dental hygienists will increase. Good dental health in large groups is leading to dental hygienists acquiring a greater role. A greater share of paediatric dental care could, for example, be performed by dental hygienists. Outreach activity among the elderly and disabled also means that demand for dental hygienists is increasing.</p>
<p>The National Agency for Higher Education pointed out fifteen years ago that is it difficult for present-day training to achieve university level and that it should be reviewed. The profession of dental hygienist has undergone great changes. The requirements set for a dental hygienist with a licence to practise cannot be satisfied in the framework of two years of study. We share this view. We are also of the view that existing curricula for the three-year training programmes which all the institutions of higher education today offer can serve as basis for deciding what a new qualification descriptor should contain.</p>
<p>• The training programme for dental hygienists should be extended to 180 higher education credits, that is to say from two years to three. The National Agency for Higher Education should be tasked with drawing up proposals for a new qualification descriptor.</p>
<h2>Qualification requirements in the social services</h2>
<p>Our task has been to survey and analyse the need for, and prospects of, regulation of qualification requirements for a number of tasks in the social services. This applies to certain types of administration, including investigation and decisions, which relate to individuals and which are carried out on behalf of the social welfare committee. We have been asked to pay special attention to political decisionmaking in the social services and what consequences regulating qualification requirements would have with regard to the supply of personnel with suitable training and experience.</p>
<h2>What is the current situation?</h2>
<p>Regulation of qualification requirements means that requirements are set for certain skills in order to be allowed to use a particular title or to carry out particular tasks. The two types of regulation can also be used simultaneously. There are already requirements in the Social Services Act today for staff to have suitable training and experience. But it is not stated what type of training and experience is to be required.</p>
<p>The National Board of Health and Welfare has issued general guidelines on the skills of staff in several different areas in the social services. Such guidelines exist for the administration and follow-up of cases relating to children and adolescents, cases concerning the elderly and people with disabilities. It is common to these general guidelines that they indicate qualification as social worker or qualification in social care according to a previous study scheme as suitable training. The general guidelines also specify a number of areas in which staff should have theoretical knowledge and practical skills, such as investigation, action, follow-up, evaluation etc.</p>
<p>The National Board of Health and Welfare has also issued regulations and general guidelines on management systems for quality in social services. The management system should also cover supply of staff and skills. There should be routines for continuously checking that staff have the skills required to carry out their tasks.</p>
<h2>The Child Protection Inquiry</h2>
<p>The Child Protection Inquiry (SOU 2009:68), which presented its proposals in July 2009, was tasked, among other things, with investigating how a high level of skill can be ensured for social welfare officers who work on the investigation, planning and follow-up of cases relating to children and adolescents. The inquiry was also asked to comment on whether there was a need for separate regulation of skills requirements.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposed that the Bachelor of Science degree in social work and public administration should be required to assess whether an investigation should be initiated, to investigate and assess the need for intervention or for other measures and to follow up interventions decided upon. The social welfare committee should offer suitable induction and support in the profession for social welfare officers who do not have any previous experience of these duties. The qualification requirements should start to apply after a transitional period of five years. The Inquiry additionally proposed that a specialist training programme of at least one year should be introduced at the advanced level. The Inquiry has presented thorough arguments for a need for such regulation for child protection cases. Virtually no objections were raised against this proposal during the consultation period following the report of the Child Protection Inquiry.</p>
<h2>Our assessment</h2>
<p>The duties concerned here are what are known as exercise of authority. This means decisions or other measures which ultimately are an expression of the powers of society in relation to its citizens. It concerns decisions on assistance, actions taken under the Law on Services for Persons with Certain Functional Impairments (LSS), on immediate taking into care etc. The handling of a case involves all measures taken, from initiation of a case until it is concluded through a final decision. It is the social welfare committee that takes the decisions, but whole groups of cases or a single case may also be delegated to officials. Case handling is very often concerned with taking difficult decisions which are of crucial importance to the client, and the individual official has great scope in taking such decisions.</p>
<p>There are already statutory requirements today for the quality and quality assurance of activities in the social services and in the Law on Services for Persons with Certain Functional Impairments, but they have not had a sufficient impact. We therefore judge there to be a need for further regulation. The prospects of the user receiving good-quality intervention are improved by clarifying what knowledge and skills are needed for this work.</p>
<p>We share the assessment of the Child Protection Inquiry that the Bachelor of Science degree in social work and public administration is the training that provides the best basis for social work. But if only the Bachelor of Science degree were to be accepted as providing the required skills, undesirable lock-in effects would arise, where people with different training are excluded from these posts. We therefore take the view that the responsible authority should have the option of also employing people with different relevant higher education for these duties. This may, for example, be a person with higher education in other areas and with advanced studies in particular in social work and/or administrative law and social law.</p>
<p>According to statistics from the Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions (SKL), around 18 000 people in the social services have duties that would be covered by the regulation on qualification requirements. Just over 7 000 of these do not hold a Bachelor of degree in social work and public administration. Of these, just over 4 000 have had post-secondary education lasting three years or more and just over 2 000 have undergone such education lasting two years.</p>
<p>There are a large number of variants of training for social workers. A student today has 37 different alternatives to choose from. If the Bachelor of Science in social work and public administration is to be a qualification requirement for certain exercise of authority throughout the social services, the basic training must become more equivalent and provide the skills required for these regulated duties. In our view, if the qualification requirements we propose are introduced, it is likely that the training of social workers will become more equivalent. Procedures should also be developed for continuous dialogue between training organisers and the social services on the content and future development of training.</p>
<p>A transitional period of five years should be introduced. This provides those who wish to have the option of supplementing their training and the responsible authorities with time to plan the activity. A model of how this boost in skills can be accomplished is for central government to offer training places, while the responsible authorities make studies possible, wholly or partly in the framework of the post of the social welfare officer concerned.</p>
<p>Our proposals will increase the demand for social workers. According to a report from the National Agency for Higher Education (2009:5R Higher Education Programmes and the Labour Market ), the supply of social workers will increase by between 40 and 50 per cent by 2025, given that the same number are trained per year as at present. There is therefore no risk of the qualification requirements being difficult to achieve due to a lack of people with the right training.</p>
<p>Like the Child Protection Inquiry, we also propose legislation on induction and support in the profession for those who do not have previous experience of the duties that are regulated.</p>
<h2>Our proposals:</h2>
<p>• Requirements should be laid down in law for the Bachelor of Science degree in social work and public administration, or other relevant qualification of at least  first-degree level in higher education, for the following tasks in social services:</p>
<p>1. assessment of whether an investigation should be initiated,</p>
<p>2. investigation and assessment of the need for intervention and other measures and</p>
<p>3. follow-up of interventions decided upon.</p>
<p>Duties 2 and 3 should be regulated for work related to the Law on Services for Persons with Certain Functional Impairments.</p>
<p>• The National Board of Health and Welfare should be tasked with cooperating with the National Agency for Higher Education to produce a basis for a more detailed description of what is meant by other relevant qualification of at least  first-degree level in higher education in the area.</p>
<p>• Existing staff should be offered  skills-raising training during a transitional period of five years.</p>
<p>• Anyone who lacks previous experience of the duties that are regulated should be given suitable induction and support in the profession for at least one year.</p>
<p>• Follow-up and evaluation should be conducted within two years after the regulation of qualification requirements has been fully implemented.</p>
