<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>The  Commission on the Review of Economic Statistics has been charged with identifying measurement and definition problems in income statistics, analysing income concepts in national accounts and income statistics, and determining how income measures can be correctly adjusted for household composition. The Commission analyses these issues in this progress report and presents a number of proposals.</p>
<p>Two new income concepts should be introduced and used as standards in official income statistics. The first is mainly intended for Swedish use and should be based on the Hicks income concept, where disposable income is defined as the income a household can consume during a given period of time while maintaining the level of wealth in real terms. The other concept disposable income is mainly intended for international comparisons and should be based on coming EU regulations regarding the EU-harmonised Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC).</p>
<p>Statistics Sweden should further develop methods and statistics for measuring returns to capital in a way that agrees with the fundamental principles of the first income concept mentioned above. Long time series should also be presented according to the new income concepts. Statistics Sweden should also annually update and report comparisons between income concepts in income statistics and national accounts. Furthermore, Statistics Sweden should publish special reports on the income distribution, as a complement to the official income statistics.</p>
<p>Official statistics should be supplemented with annual wealth statistics and more timely preliminary income statistics, which should be published in August of the year after the income year in question. These two proposals are included in the 2003-2005 Budget Request for Statistics Sweden, which Statistics Sweden submitted to the government in February 2002.</p>
<p>In accordance with the EU decision on the European System of National Accounts (ESA 95), the household sector in the national accounts should be divided up into two sectors, one for actual households and one for non-profit institutions serving households. Non-profit institutions serving households should be a separate area in official statistics and periodical statistics in this area should be published starting in 2003. This proposal is also included in the 2003-2005 Budget Request for Statistics Sweden .</p>
<p>The housekeeping household should be the standard concept used in the annual survey Households’ Economy and in the coming EU-harmonised sample survey EU-SILC. A household definition based on the dwelling household should be the standard concept used in register based income statistics if and when the recommendations in the report “Improved household and dwelling statistics instead of a census” have been implemented. Comparable studies should be conducted on income statistics based on the housekeeping household and the dwelling household, and the two Reports on Statistical Co-ordination for the Official Statistics of Sweden regarding definitions of household and family should be reviewed and revised.</p>
<p>A new equivalence scale called the Swedish equivalence scale  should be introduced and used as the standard in official income statistics. The scale’s weights for different types of individuals are presented in the table below. Two basic consumption levels, which are connected with the equivalence scale, should be defined and used in calculating the weights in the Swedish equivalence scale. The equivalence scale and both consumption levels should be calculated and reported annually by Statistics Sweden in cooperation with the Swedish Consumer Agency, the National Board of Health and Welfare, and the National Board of Housing, Building and Planning.</p>

<p>The Commission’s proposals, which are discussed in the 2003-2005  Budget Request for Statistics Sweden,  will cost approximately SEK 1.7 million annually. In addition to these costs, there will be some other recurring and one-time costs. The commission will readdress the issues of costs and financing in its final report.</p>
