<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Remit</h2>
<p>Our remit has been to investigate questions concerning the processing of personal data in anti-doping work in sport. The purpose of our remit has been to ensure that the rules in the EU’s ‘Data Protection Regulation’ are followed. Our remit has included examining the consequences of the Data Protection Regulation for questions concerning the processing of personal data in anti-doping work in sport and analysing the need for special regulations for this processing. We have also had the remit of assessing the need for statutory provisions on secrecy and the obligation to observe confidentiality.</p>
<h2>A new act on data protection in anti-doping work in sport</h2>
<p>The Data Protection Regulation has been applicable since 25 May 2018. The Regulation is now the general legislation for the processing of personal data in the EU and is directly applicable in Sweden. The Data Protection Regulation both presumes and permits national provisions that supplement parts of the Regulation through specifications or exemptions and derogations.</p>
<p>The processing of personal data is a necessary part of anti-doping work in sport. A large part of the personal data processed in antidoping work relates to sensitive data mainly about the health of athletes. However, for it to be at all possible to process personal data in anti-doping work, there must be a legal basis for this processing in the Data Protection Regulation. We have concluded that this processing of personal data can rely on the legal basis that it is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest (Article 6(1)(e) of the Data Protection Regulation). However, for it to be possible to use that legal basis, national legislation needs to be introduced. We have also concluded that the processing of sensitive personal data in anti-doping work can rely on the exemption for a substantial public interest in Article 9(2)(g) of the Data Protection Regulation. This exemption can only be used if national legislation safeguarding the fundamental rights and the interests of the data subject in anti-doping work is introduced. For these and other reasons we propose the introduction of a statute containing provisions on the processing of personal data in anti-doping work in sport. We propose that the statute should be an act and be called the act on data protection in anti-doping work in sport.</p>
<p>The purpose of the act should be to make possible the processing of personal data in anti-doping work in sport in an appropriate way and to protect natural persons from interference with their personal privacy in this processing.</p>
<h2>Anti-doping work in sport</h2>
<p>Anti-doping work in sport is governed by the World Anti-Doping Code adopted by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). The World Anti-Doping Code is intended to guarantee the athletes their fundamental right to participate in doping-free sport and thus promote health, fairness and equality for athletes. It is also intended to harmonise anti-doping work in sport at the international and national level. In the first place, it is the bodies that have signed the World Anti-Doping Code, i.e. the code signatories, that are bound by the Code. As an example, a national anti-doping organisation (NADO), an international sports federation or an event organisation can be a code signatory. But bodies other than signatories can also perform anti-doping work on account of the Code.</p>
<p>The World Anti-Doping Code contains rules that code signatories are obliged to follow. For instance, it regulates what are anti-doping rule violations. The Code also includes provisions about anti-doping testings, athlete’s whereabouts information, result management and the investigation of anti-doping rule violations. There are a number of international standards, six at present, that belong to the World Anti-Doping Code; adherence to them is mandatory for the code signatories. One international standard relates to therapeutic use exemptions from the anti-doping rules; another standard relates to testing and investigation. A further standard relates to the protection of privacy and personal information. That standard states that it is not applicable if it breaches national legislation.</p>
<p>By ratifying the Council of Europe’s Anti-Doping Convention and its Additional Protocol and UNESCO’s International Convention against Doping in Sport, Sweden has assumed a responsibility to combat doping in sport. Sweden has also given its approval to the anti-doping work performed in accordance with the Code. In addition, Sweden has committed to the principles of the Code.</p>
<p>The proposed law defines anti-doping work in sport as anti-doping work performed on account of the World Anti-Doping Code or the international standards that supplement the Code.</p>
<h2>Scope of the Act</h2>
<p>We propose that the act on data protection in anti-doping work in sport should apply to all processing of personal data that takes place in Sweden in anti-doping work performed on account of the World Anti-Doping Code or the international standards that belong to the Code. Participants in anti-doping work that are established in Sweden should be covered by the act irrespective of where their processing of personal data is performed.</p>
<p>In Sweden anti-doping work in sport is mainly performed by the Swedish Sports Confederation (RF), which is an NGO and the umbrella organisation for most of the Swedish sports movement. The Confederation has 71 national special sports federations as members. Its base consists of around 3.1 million members and around 20 000 local sports associations affiliated to their special sports federations. At regional level, these local associations are affiliated to special sports federations and district sports federations.</p>
<p>The Swedish Sports Confederation is a signatory to the World Anti-Doping Code and is the national anti-doping organisation (NADO) of Swedish sport in accordance with the Code. Under the World Anti-Doping Code, the Confederation is therefore obliged to perform anti-doping work in sport in Sweden. The Confederation also receives the entire central government appropriation for antidoping action.</p>
<p>Anti-doping work in the Confederation is led and coordinated by the independent Doping Commission elected by the Confederation’s General Assembly. However, the operational work is performed by the Anti-Doping Department of the Confederation, under the name of Swedish Anti-Doping. Work in the Department can be divided into five different areas: handling of applications for therapeutic use exemptions, handling of athlete’s whereabouts information, doping controls, result management and intelligence work. However, the Confederation's statutes provide that anti-doping work is conducted in all parts of the organisation. We have therefore concluded that the act should be applicable to all the processing of personal data that is performed in anti-doping work on account of the World AntiDoping Code by the Swedish Sports Confederation and by the associations and federations affiliated to the Confederation.</p>
<p>There are also a small number of associations and special sports federations that are not affiliated to the Swedish Sports Confederation but that are affiliated to an international sports federation that is a signatory to the World Anti-Doping Code. Examples include the Swedish Bodybuilding and Fitness Federation and affiliated associations. Our proposal is that they should also be covered by the act to the extent that they process personal data in anti-doping work performed in accordance with the World Anti-Doping Code.</p>
<p>Anti-doping work in Sweden can also be performed by foreign entities. Our proposals also cover the processing of personal data that takes place when signatories to the World Anti-Doping Code other than the Swedish Sports Confederation – such as international special sports federations and the national anti-doping organisations of other countries – process personal data in Sweden when performing doping controls here in accordance with the World Anti-Doping Code.</p>
<p>We also propose that the act should be applicable to bodies that perform anti-doping work on behalf of a signatory to the World Anti-Doping Code. At present there is one private service company, International Doping Tests & Management AB IDTM, that is established in Sweden whose activities include the performance of doping tests in accordance with the rules of the World Anti-Doping Code on behalf of signatories to the Code. There are also a few companies that perform anti-doping work on an international basis on behalf of a signatory to the World Anti-Doping Code and that can therefore be covered by our proposals to the extent that they process personal data in Sweden.</p>
<p>The Act should only apply to the processing of personal data if it is wholly or partly automated or if the personal data forms part of or is intended to form part of a structured set of data which are accessible for searching or compilation according to specific criteria.</p>
<h2>Relationship to other legislation</h2>
<p>The proposed act supplements the directly applicable provisions of the Data Protection Regulation. The Data Protection Act (2018:218), which contains general supplementary provisions to the Data Protection Regulation, is also applicable, unless otherwise provided by the proposed act.</p>
<p>Along with the Data Protection Regulation and the Data Protection Act, the act will take precedence to the sports movement’s internal regulations on the processing of personal data.</p>
<p>The proposed act will not apply when personal data are processed at the Doping laboratory of Karolinska University Hospital pursuant to the Patient Data Act (2008:355).</p>
<h2>Control of personal data</h2>
<p>In our assessment, each body covered by the act is the controller for the processing of personal data performed by that body in the antidoping work of sport. We propose stating this in the act for the sake of clarity.</p>
<h2>Provisions about purposes</h2>
<p>Under the proposed act, personal data may only be collected and processed in other ways in the anti-doping work of sport if this is necessary for certain purposes specified in the act. These proposals cover the purposes for which personal data needs to be collected and processed in order to perform work under the World Anti-Doping Code and the associated standards. The provisions on purposes are optional in the sense that they regulate what the participants in antidoping work may do. So the point of the provisions on purposes is to set an outer limit for when personal data may be collected and continue to be processed pursuant to the act on data protection in the anti-doping work of sport and the Data Protection Regulation. Moreover, the purposes stated are exhaustive in the sense that the various participants covered by the act may not make their own decisions about additional purposes for which personal data will be collected in their activities.</p>
<p>In the anti-doping work of sport, data is disclosed to other participants via WADA’s ADAMS database or some other system approved by WADA. The disclosure is made within the framework of anti-doping work and follows from the World Anti-Doping Code. The recipients are other signatories to the World Anti-Doping Code or service companies performing their work on behalf of a signatory and in accordance with the Code. The disclosure is therefore made as part of the same global anti-doping work and normally takes place in the activities of each signatory. The disclosure of information that takes place as part of anti-doping work in sport is covered by the act’s primary provisions on purposes.</p>
<p>There is a small amount of disclosure of personal data from participants in anti-doping work to law enforcement agencies. The proposed act also permits the processing of personal data if this is necessary in order to provide information needed in law enforcement activities in the Swedish Police Authority, the Swedish Prosecution Authority or the Swedish Customs. The proposed provision opens up a possibility for participants in anti-doping work to disclose data about suspected doping-related offences to the relevant law enforcement authorities.</p>
<p>The transfer of personal data to a third country in anti-doping work in sport can take place pursuant to the provisions of the Data Protection Regulation. So no special provisions about this need to be included in the proposed act.</p>
<h2>Sensitive personal data and data relating to criminal offences</h2>
<p>Article 9(1) of the Data Protection Regulation contains a principled prohibition of the processing of special categories of personal data, also called ‘sensitive personal data’. There are, however, a number of exemptions from the prohibition. If the data subject has given explicit consent to the processing of those personal data for one or more specified purposes, the data may be processed (9(2)(a)). In addition, certain sensitive personal data may be processed if, among other reasons, the processing is necessary for reasons of substantial public interest, on the basis of Union or Member State law (9(2)(g)). According to our proposals, only sensitive personal data concerning health, genetic data or biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, may be processed in anti-doping work in sport pursuant to Article 9(2)(g) of the Data Protection Regulation.</p>
<p>Article 10 of the Data Protection Regulation contains special provisions about the processing of personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences. Information that an athlete has committed an anti-doping rule violation under the internal rules of sport does not concern a criminal conviction. In our assessment, it does not relate to an offence in the meaning of Article 10 of the Data Protection Regulation either. Personal data like this could, nevertheless, be processed in anti-doping work. According to our proposals, personal data concerning criminal offences may be processed to handle cases concerning anti-doping rule violations. They may also be processed in the intelligence work conducted by the Swedish Sports Confederation under the World Anti-Doping Code.</p>
<h2>Public disclosure of data concerning anti-doping rule violations</h2>
<p>The World Anti-Doping Code provides that data about athletes suspended for doping must be publicly disclosed. In the case of the Swedish Sports Confederation, the data is published on the internet. We have concluded that this publication is problematic from a privacy perspective. Since the publication takes place pursuant to a certificate of no legal impediment to publication and therefore under the protection of the Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression, there are, however, very limited possibilities of intervening pursuant to the Data Protection Regulation. In our view, the Swedish Sports Confederation should, however, consider a new system under which the relevant data can be made available to those who have a legitimate interest in it.</p>
<h2>Rights of individuals</h2>
<p>We have not concluded that it would be either necessary or proportionate to limit the right of individuals to object to the processing of personal data in the proposed act. Nor have we found reasons to make any other exemptions from the rights of the data subject under the Data Protection Regulation.</p>
<h2>Maximum retention period</h2>
<p>The maximum period during which personal data may be retained in anti-doping work in sport for various purposes is set out in an international standard belonging to the World Anti-Doping Code. In our assessment, the act should not contain any detailed regulations restricting the maximum retention period decided by WADA and followed in other countries. However, we propose the insertion into the act of a general provision stating that personal data may not be processed for a longer period than is necessary in view of the purpose of the processing. The purpose of the proposed provision is to counter routine retention.</p>
<p>The international standard does not contain any provisions about how long personal data may be processed in intelligence work. However, the processing of personal data in this work is particularly sensitive in terms of privacy. We are therefore proposing a provision stating that personal data may not be processed in intelligence work for a longer period than three years after the end of the calendar year when the data was processed for the first time. If any new data reading the same person’s link to doping activities is processed before the end of that period, the personal data already held about the person may continue to be processed as long as any of the data may be processed.</p>
<h2>Additional safeguards</h2>
<p>We have analysed whether the act should contain additional provisions intended to secure the fundamental rights and interests of individuals in anti-doping work in sport. Possible safeguards of this kind are discussed in chapter 11. Here we propose a provision stating that access to personal data shall be limited to what each individual person needs to enable them to carry out their duties. We also propose that the Swedish Sports Confederation and other bodies that are established in Sweden and perform anti-doping work on behalf of a signatory to the World Anti-Doping Code shall appoint a data protection officer for their processing of personal data in anti-doping work.</p>
<h2>Secrecy</h2>
<p>In our view, there is no need to amend the secrecy legislation. We have, however, concluded that there is reason for the Swedish Sports Confederation to review Chapter 13, Section 8 of the Statutes of the Swedish Sports Confederation.</p>
<h2>Impacts</h2>
<p>Our proposals mean stronger protection for the personal privacy of individuals in anti-doping work in sport. The proposals can also have positive impacts on action to combat doping-related crime. In our assessment, the proposals will mean that some training and information are needed. However, they are not assessed as leading to cost increases for the public institutions.</p>
