<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>The remit</h2>
<p>Pursuant to the Government’s authorisation of 11 December 2008, the Head of the Ministry of the Environment has appointed a Committee of Inquiry to examine the prospects for harmonising the rules concerning activities in the field of nuclear technology and radiation protection.</p>
<p>Terms of reference</p>
<p>Under its terms of reference, the Committee is to focus in particular on the feasibility of merging the provisions of the Nuclear Operations Act (1984:3) and the Radiation Protection Act in a single law. The aim is to simplify the structure and formulation of the provisions and make them more effective without thereby jeopardising public requirements regarding nuclear safety and radiation protection.</p>
<p>The terms of reference further state that - certain basic terms in the Nuclear Operations Act and the Radiation Protection Act governing application of the rules and how these affect other legislation should be analysed more closely, - study should be made of the licensing rules governing nuclear operations and practices involving radiation, and also of the rules concerning the security screening of staff, with a view to enhancing coherence, - special attention should be focused on the supervision of compliance with the Nuclear Operations Act and the Radiation</p>
<p>Protection Act, including supervision of the use of radiation sources in the healthcare and industrial sectors, - government supervision as regulated by the provisions on local safety committees should be given due attention, - the rules governing punitive measures in each of the two legislative spheres are to be reviewed, and in this connection special consideration is to be given to the possibility of applying environmental sanction charges instead of penal provisions, - the development of legislative efforts in this field within the European Union – particularly the Community framework for the nuclear safety of nuclear installations, 2009/71/EURATOM – is to be considered in this respect, along with Sweden’s other international commitments.</p>
<p>In addition, the Committee is to examine the need for – and where relevant the formulation of – legal provisions establishing longterm responsibility for the sealed repository for spent nuclear fuel.</p>
<p>A further matter passed that the Ministry of the Environment has passed to the Committee for consideration concerns interagency cooperation and the need to revise the rules relating to nuclear non-proliferation, particularly those dealing with the import and export of nuclear material and strong radiation sources.</p>
<p>The Committee is to present proposals specifying whatever changes in the laws and regulations may be deemed necessary. Such proposals must seek to ensure that supervision in the nuclear and radiation field is accomplished in a more cost-effective manner.</p>
<p>Other issues deriving from the terms of reference</p>
<p>Under the Committee’s terms of reference, the report of the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority entitled Review of Swedish Legislation in the Radiation Safety Field is to be given due consideration in the course of the inquiry. In its contacts with the ministry, the agency has made clear that the following issues will require special consideration: - the terms ‘nuclear activity’ and  ‘radiation-related activity’ should be reviewed. - the term ‘nuclear waste’ should if possible be abolished and ‘radioactive waste’ be introduced as a uniform term for all types of residual products containing radioactive substances. - the purport of the terms ‘best available technology’ (BAT) and three of the basic principles of radiation protection – ‘justification’, ‘optimisation’ (aka ALARA) and ‘dose limits’ – should, together with the nuclear safety principle of ‘proven design’, be integrated in new and coherent legislation. - the basic safety principles formulated by the International Atomic Energy Authority, IAEA, should serve as a guide in preparing the new law, - the principles of ‘barriers and  defence-in-depth’ should provide the basic starting point for a new, harmonised law, - the exemption rules in the Nuclear Operations Act and the Radiation Protection Act (clearance) should be harmonised and expressed more clearly than is the case in present legislation, - the rules concerning (sub)contractors under Section 5, second paragraph of the Nuclear Operations Act should be reviewed, - a minimum age limit of 18 years should be considered for the use of solariums. - the use of cosmetic lasers should be more clearly regulated than is the case under present legislation, - regulation of the use of laser pointers and other devices of a similar kind.</p>
<h2>Reform needs – identifying problem areas</h2>
<p>The need to simplify and streamline the rules on nuclear operations and other practices involving radiation has long been discussed . Since the Environmental Code, the Nuclear Operations Act and the Radiation Protection Act are to be applied in parallel, licence conditions decided on by the Environment Court in a permit application case pursuant to the Environmental Code may encompass measures already required under the provisions of the other two laws.</p>
<p>It is not only this double licensing procedure – the overlapping application process where two separate permits have the same legal force – that is said to be causing problems. Other issues caused by a lack of legislative coherence have also been raised.</p>
<p>The inquiry has summarised the problem areas that have come to its attention as follows: - the Environmental Code, the Nuclear Operations Act and the Radiation Protection Act are more overlapping in character than parallel; their provisions regulate the same types of substantive issues from partially different starting points. - application processing under the Environmental Code, the Nuclear Operations Act and the Radiation Protection Act is one example of an overlapping regulatory practice, - lack of coherence between the three laws results in unnecessary double processing and means that resources are not being used to maximum advantage, - licence applications for small, environmentally ‘limited’ or relatively harmless activities are dealt with needlessly high up in the judicial chain; in contrast to more extensive application cases it seems unnecessary for such matters to be examined by the Government or by an environmental court, - the regulations should be harmonised to enable licensing and supervisory procedures to be adapted to the hazard potential of the activity in question and to the need for special skills on the part of the operator. - the terms ‘nuclear activity’ and ‘practices involving radiation’ overlap and are unclear – and are also based on different premises, since the former embodies a permit requirement while the latter does not, - the terms ‘radioactive waste’ and ‘nuclear waste’ overlap – the distinctions are difficult to maintain and do not fulfil any purpose, - the rules in the Nuclear Operations Act concerning the approval of (sub)contractors and entrepreneurs should be simplified, - the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority supervises application of the Nuclear Operations Act, the Radiation Protection Act and the Environmental Code with regard to ionising and nonionising activity; thus the agency is formally empowered to choose whether a certain requirement should be imposed in accordance with one or the other of the three. For the sake of legal security, the supervisory rules should be harmonised, - appeals against siting decisions by the Radiation Safety Authority must be harmonised – currently, the same matter/case may be considered either by the Government, by an administrative court or by an environmental court depending on whether the agency decides to base its decision on the Environmental Code, the Nuclear Operations Act or the Radiation Protection Act, - the sanction provisions set out in the Nuclear Operations Act, the Radiation Protection Act and the Environmental Code overlap and should therefore be harmonised; the penal provisions in Chapter 29 of the Environmental Code and the rules concerning environmental sanction charges in Chapter 30 also apply in the case of activities coming under the Nuclear Operations Act or the Radiation Protection Act. An offence may therefore be punishable under all three.</p>
<h2>Structure of the inquiry work</h2>
<p>In light of the need for regulatory simplification and more effective legislation in the field of nuclear technology and radiation protection, as noted by the Committee, the inquiry has focused partly  on ways of merging the substantive rules in the Nuclear Operations Act and the Radiation Protection Act in a joint set of regulations, and partly  on the prospects for integrating these into the Environmental Code as a further step.</p>
<p>The Committee has sought to ensure that legal security is enhanced when the rules are applied.</p>
<p>It has also undertaken a systematic review of the rules in the Environmental Code that impact on practices involving radiation, and has made a closer study of some basic terms in the Nuclear Operations Act and the Radiation Protection Act that have in one way or another influenced the way the rules have been applied.</p>
<p>Special attention has been devoted to the terms nuclear waste and radioactive waste.</p>
<p>The Committee has also analysed the rules governing the licensing of nuclear activities and practices involving radiation. Supervision of compliance with the Nuclear Operations Act and the Radiation Protection Act has been a focus of special attention, along with the rules concerning sanctions in each legislative area.</p>
<h2>The inquiry’s deliberations on harmonisation/integration</h2>
<p>Prospects for merging the rules in the Radiation Protection Act, the Nuclear Operations Act and the Environmental Code – Regulatory simplification and enhanced efficiency</p>
<p>The inquiry has studied various ways of harmonising the substantive rules. Four possible solutions have been identified. 1. Provisions concerning the licensing process for new major facilities and for output increases in nuclear power reactors are integrated into the Environmental Code, while other provisions are gathered in a separate ‘radiation safety act’. 2. Provisions concerning radiation safety are collected in a separate ‘radiation safety act’ but otherwise no changes are made in current regulations. 3. The terms ionising and  non-ionising radiation are deleted from the Environmental Code. 4. Provisions concerning radiation safety are integrated in their entirety into the Environmental Code .</p>
<p>In the Committee’s view, the close links between the regulations in the Environmental Code, the Nuclear Operations Act and the Radiation Protection Act suggest that the provisions concerning nuclear safety and radiation protection should be integrated into the Environmental Code.</p>
<p>The Radiation Safety Inquiry has concluded that radiation protection and nuclear safety matters cannot always be kept separate and need to be considered in a single context. The need to harmonise safety and radiation protection interests is evident in almost all stages of the nuclear fuel cycle and makes itself felt both when studying and processing the data on which the design of a facility is based and when considering what measures need to be taken when the facility goes online. In practice, too, certain supervisory measures under the three sets of provisions have overlapped to some extent.</p>
<p>In the Committee’s view, there is no longer any justification for regulating nuclear activity by means of special rules in a separate law, as has been the case since 1956. The type of activity governed by the Nuclear Operations Act and the Radiation Protection Act can and should be subject to harmonised rules in joint legislation in this field.</p>
<p>Since its inception, the Environmental Code has covered ionising and non-ionising radiation. Besides injury/inconvenience arising from ionising radiation, the Code’s area of application extends to safety at nuclear facilities, supervisory matters and the operators’ own control systems. Thus there are a number of close links between the rules in the Environmental Code, the Nuclear Operations Act and the Radiation Protection Act.</p>
<p>The rules overlap in several respects. The general rules of consideration and the environmental quality standards set out in the Environmental Code are also subject to review under the Nuclear Operations Act. The rules of consideration in the Radiation Protection Act serve the same purpose as the general rules of consideration in the Environmental Code.</p>
<p>Nor are there any formal obstacles to prevent legislators, on the basis of the Code rules, from formulating requirements and stipulating conditions that cover both nuclear safety and radiation protection. This means that in licensing cases pursuant to the Environmental Code, matters relating to site security and protection against ionising radiation may be examined equally thoroughly under the Nuclear Operations Act or the Radiation Protection Act, depending on which purpose each individual law is required to fulfil.</p>
<p>The stated aim of the Environmental Code – to promote sustainable development that assures present and future generations of a healthy and good environment – also reflects the aims of the Nuclear Operations Act and the Radiation Protection Act. The protection of people and the environment prescribed by the Environmental Code refers to protection not only against injury and damage but also against other inconveniences, i.e. disturbances that reduce people’s well-being in a medical or hygienic sense.</p>
<p>One advantage of placing all provisions on radiation safety in the Environmental Code is that formally speaking its rules already cover practices involving both ionising and non-ionising radiation. Another advantage is that certain rules in the Environmental Code, such as the general rules of consideration, are already being applied and are taken into account when cases are dealt with under the Nuclear Operations Act. The supervision chapter in the Code is complete and in principle does not require any changes if substantive radiation safety provisions are introduced into it. The same applies to the provisions on sanctions in chapters 29 and 30 of the Code.</p>
<p>In the Committee’s view, the integrated assessment of sources of disturbance that becomes possible if the rules set out in the Nuclear Operations Act and the Radiation Protection Act are incorporated in the Environmental Code would make it easier to gain an overall picture of the environmental risks involved. This in turn would strengthen safety and radiation protection in accordance with government requirements.</p>
<p>Also, harmonisation of the provisions on nuclear safety and radiation protection in the Environmental Code would lead to simplification of the rules, e.g. through the elimination of the widely criticised procedure of considering permit applications twice over for facilities engaging in practices involving radiation.</p>
<p>A further advantage of having a single overall licensing procedure under the Environmental Code instead of dealing with applications under the Nuclear Operations Act, is that it would embrace the right of public attendance, as expressed in Chapter 2, Article 11, second paragraph of the Swedish Instrument of Government and in Chapter 5, Section 1, first paragraph of the Swedish Code of Judicial Procedure. It follows from these provisions that court proceedings are to be open to the public as a general rule. Thus the Environment Court would deal with cases concerning environmentally hazardous activities at a main hearing to which the general public has access. Referral bodies sometimes attend these proceedings and are required to answer questions put to them by the court. Certain NGOs are entitled to appeal against rulings and decisions. Under the present Nuclear Operations Act or the Radiation Protection Act, licensing applications are prepared and examined by means of a written procedure that does not offer the same general public access as a main hearing in the Environment Court.</p>
<p>If the rules are harmonised in the Environmental Code, the Government would be able to focus on assessing the permissibility of major new facilities pursuant to Chapter 17 of the Code, instead of engaging in technical deliberations on safety and radiation protection, aspects that are better dealt with by the Radiation Safety Authority.</p>
<p>An important legal consideration in this respect is that harmonised rules would make it easier for a party to appeal against supervisory decisions taken by that agency.</p>
<p>Certain matters in the Nuclear Operations Act, however, may be difficult to fit into the Environmental Code since to some extent they have a different purpose. Certain special rules may therefore be required in respect of issues concerning the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>In considering where in the Environmental Code the provisions on nuclear safety and radiation protection might best be placed, the Committee has found that several of the substantive provisions in Chapter 12, ‘Quarries, agriculture and other activities’, have been abolished and that the chapter now contains very few paragraphs. These provisions can, without changing their substantive content, usefully be moved to Chapter 7, ‘Protection of areas’, and Chapter 9, ‘Environmentally hazardous activities and health protection’.</p>
<p>In sum, as a result of the Committee’s deliberations, it is proposed that the current Chapter 12 be deleted, to be replaced by substantive rules concerning nuclear safety and radiation protection under a new heading, ‘Nuclear safety’. It is further proposed that these provisions apply to both ionising and nonionising radiation and be collectively designated ‘practices involving radiation’.</p>
<p>Under this proposal, the term ‘practices involving radiation’ is given the same legislative scope as it possesses today under the Nuclear Operations Act and the Radiation Protection Act.</p>
<p>Radiation safety – a collective term encapsulating the purpose of a harmonised law</p>
<p>Coherent legislation on radiation safety must clearly define what the terms it employs refer to in various connections. It must also use terminology that enables it to communicate smoothly with the outside world in the contexts of both international cooperation on policy matters and development aid provision.</p>
<p>At the same time, a collective, unifying term is needed for the various purposes that coherent legislation is intended to embrace. The Radiation Safety Inquiry contends that ‘radiation safety’ is such a term.</p>
<p>The Committee proposes that the term ‘nuclear safety’ be used as a collective designation for a) radiation protection : the protection of people and the environment against the harmful effects of radiation, through justification of use, optimisation of protective measures and the limitation of radiation doses and exposure risks, b) safety : protection against the harmful effects of radiation by taking whatever steps are necessary to prevent defects in equipment, equipment failure, wrong handling or other circumstances that may lead to accidents, and to facilitate the combating of breakdowns and the limitation or delay of emissions should an accident nevertheless occur, c) physical protection : protection of operations, facilities and equipment against incursions, unauthorised use, theft, sabotage or other action liable to cause harm through radiation. d) non-proliferation: measures designed to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons at both national and international level, and measures to verify that such proliferation is not occurring.</p>
<p>Practices involving radiation</p>
<p>The Committee proposes that the term ‘practices involving radiation’ be used as a collective designation for a) nuclear operations involving the erection, possession or operation of - a facility that is or has been intended to accommodate a regulated nuclear chain reaction (nuclear reactor), - a facility in which processes involving ionising radiation occur (spallation or other similar process), where the content of the radioactive substances generated requires cooling, - a facility for mining or extracting material containing uranium or other substances with fissile or fertile properties that can be used for the production of fuel for facilities intended to accommodate a regulated chain reaction of nuclear processes (nuclear fuel), - a facility for the management or processing of radioactive substances, - a permanent deposition facility (final disposal repository) or other accumulation (storage) of radioactive waste. b) other practices involving radiation relating to - the possession, acquisition, sale, letting or conveyance of radioactive substances or technical appliances capable of generating radiation, - the import or introduction into Sweden of radioactive substances or technical appliances capable of generating radiation, - the export or exportation from Sweden of  non-nuclear radioactive substances or technical appliances capable of generating radiation, - the transportation or transit through Sweden of radioactive substances, - the use of technical appliances capable of generating radiation, - the use of technical appliances containing a radioactive substance.</p>
<p>Mandatory licensing, notification and approval</p>
<p>In view of the close links between the rules in the Environmental Code, the Nuclear Operations Act and the Radiation Protection Act respectively, the Committee has proposed that the provisions concerning nuclear safety and radiation safety be merged in</p>
<p>Chapter 12 of the Environmental Code under the heading ‘Radiation safety’. It is further proposed that these provisions apply to both ionising and non-ionising radiation and be collectively designated ‘practices involving radiation’.</p>
<p>Scope of the licensing requirement</p>
<p>A basic principle should be that all practices involving radiation require a licence under the Environmental Code. In light of the special nature of practices involving ionising radiation – which is particularly evident where nuclear power reactors or a final repository for spent nuclear fuel are concerned – the Committee proposes that the licensing requirement be stated directly in the text of the legal provisions in Chapter 12. The licensing, approval or notification requirement should apply as soon as work is initiated, i.e. when a facility is erected or when some other practice involving radiation is engaged in.</p>
<p>In the case of practices involving non-ionising radiation, conditions are fundamentally different. Non-ionising radiation is the type that surrounds us all in our everyday lives, i.e. all visible radiation, ultraviolet radiation, infrared radiation and radio waves and microwaves, and the low-frequency and static fields that are found for instance around power lines and electrical appliances. In light of this, the Committee proposes that the Government be required to prescribe which practices involving non-ionising radiation may not be engaged in without a licence. At present, certain practices involving lasers and solariums require licensing or notification to the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority.</p>
<p>Government assessments of permissibility</p>
<p>If substantive radiation safety provisions are introduced into Chapter 12 of the Environmental Code, and the Nuclear Operations Act thereby no longer applies, the kinds of facilities and activities that will require government approval via permissibility assessments in accordance with Chapter 17, Section 1 of the Environmental Code should be clearly specified so that small-scale facilities which have hitherto been kept out of the assessment process are not brought into it.</p>
<p>The Committee proposes that the following facilities be required to undergo permissibility assessments: 1. Facilities in which a controllable chain reaction of nuclear processes can be maintained (nuclear power reactors, research reactors and other reactors of a similar type), 2. Facilities in which processes with ionising radiation occur (spallation or other similar processes) and where the content of the radioactive substances which occur during the process needs cooling, 3. Facilities for the mining or extraction of  uranium-bearing material or other compounds/substances that can be used for the production of fuel for the facilities listed in point 1 (nuclear fuel), 4. Facilities for the management or processing of enriched uranium or of a compound of which such uranium is a part and which contains more than 20 per cent or more of the isotope 235 and where the total amount does not exceed 5 kilograms 5. Facilities where more than 2 kilogram or more of the isotope 233 in pure form or as part of a compound is managed or processed, 6. Facilities where more than 2 kilograms of plutonium in pure form or as part of a compound is managed or processed, 7. Facilities for the final disposal or interim storage of nuclear material, radioactive waste, spent nuclear fuel or other radioactive substances where the estimated total amount of radioactive substances exceeds 10 terabecquerel (TBq), of which a maximum 10 gigabecquerel (GBq) comprises alpha active substances,</p>
<p>Given the above specification, the proposed new regulation will cover the same types of facilities as the present one.</p>
<p>From a business, energy, employment, climate and regional policy viewpoint, raising the thermal output ceiling in an existing nuclear power reactor may be equated with replacing an existing reactor with a new one. In light of this, the Committee proposes the insertion of a new paragraph in Section 1 stipulating that such an increase in output necessitates a permissibility assessment on the part of the Government.</p>
<p>Assessment bodies</p>
<p>In the Committee’s view, the licensing procedure should be adapted to the hazard potential involved and to the need for special skills on the part of the operator. It is reasonable to expect the Environment Court to focus its efforts on assessing large facilities and issues of fundamental importance. The Committee proposes therefore that the courts consider applications for the erection, possession and operation of large new facilities engaging in practices involving ionising radiation, for the decommissioning of such facilities, for both output increases in existing nuclear power reactors and for exemption from the obligations that parties engaging in practices involving radiation are normally required to meet, and for changes in ownership of a facility.</p>
<p>Less complicated matters could usefully be settled through adjudication by the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority. This would release the Environment Court from such duties while at the same time strengthening the role of the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority as an expert body.</p>
<p>Examples of licensing cases that, under the Committee proposals, might well be dealt with by the agency include licence renewals for certain large facilities and applications for the interim storage or final disposal of radioactive waste from abroad. At present, under the Nuclear Operations Act, such applications are considered by the Government. In addition, the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority deals with numerous licence applications in the radiation safety field, including the possession and use etc of small amounts of nuclear material, radiation sources, X-ray equipment and strong lasers, and the transportation of nuclear material and radioactive waste.</p>
<p>Other relevant environmental consequences of an activity – such as noise, vibration and discharges of waste water – that may come up in connection with the review of a practice involving radiation will continue to be dealt with by the county administrative boards’ environmental review committees, as before.</p>
<h2>Licensing procedure for facilities engaging in practices involving radiation</h2>
<p>Preparation of nuclear safety issues prior to permissibility assessments by the Government</p>
<p>The Committee proposes that the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority be required to prepare applications due for permissibility assessment by the Government, in parallel with and in collaboration with the environment court concerned. The agency’s assessment is to focus on radiation safety issues associated with the activity. In considering the matter, the agency is also to propose conditions involving a step-by-step assessment of the facility’s erection process. The question of best available technology in various connections – in terms of safety and radiation protection – is to be specified at each step along the way.</p>
<p>The Committee proposes the introduction of a new paragraph into the Environmental Code – Chapter 19, Article 1a – stipulating that the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority be required to examine the nuclear safety aspect in preparing the Government’s permissibility assessment of new facilities for the pursuit of practices involving radiation, and also be required to state its own opinion in turning over the matter to the Government for final consideration. In expressing its opinion to the Government, the agency can propose conditions involving step-by-step assessment of the facility’s erection process, with the question of best available technology in terms of safety and radiation protection being specified at each step along the way. The Swedish Radiation Safety Authority is to focus in its preparatory work on the radiation safety aspects of the operation.</p>
<p>To enable the agency to prepare such cases, the Committee proposes that a new rule be added to Chapter 2, Section 4 of the Environmental Code specifying that in matters concerning radiation safety the Environment Court will be required to send both the announcement and the application documents not only to the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency and certain other agencies but also to the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority.</p>
<p>Content of applications in licensing cases</p>
<p>The Committee further proposes that a clause be added to Chapter 22, Section 1 of the Environmental Code setting out special provisions for cases concerning practices involving radiation. These provisions are to tie in with the safety provisions concerning such practices described in Chapter 12 of the Code.</p>
<p>Thus the Committee proposes that in cases concerning practices involving radiation submitted to the Environment Court for consideration, applications must also include: 1. a preliminary safety report in accordance with regulations issued by the Government, 2. an account of how the provisions in Chapter 12, Section 26 concerning economic, administrative and staff resources have been met, and 3. an account of how proximity to another operation may affect safety in the facility for which the application is being made.</p>
<p>Right to plead in licensing cases under the Environmental Code</p>
<p>The Växjö Environment Court, in commenting on the Committee’s interim report (Nuclear Power: New Reactors and Increased Liability), has proposed that the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority when necessary be granted the right to plead in court in respect of cases affecting the agency’s sphere of responsibility. The Committee shares this view and proposes that a new rule be added to Chapter 22, Section 6 of the Environmental Code stating that the Radiation Safety Authority may represent the public interest regarding radioactive safety and may be accorded the status of a party in court in representing such interest. The Radiation Safety Authority may also present motions in court and appeal against court decisions.</p>
<p>The Växjö Environment Court has also proposed that to enable it to represent the public interest in matters concerning radiation protection, the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority should be granted the right to apply for the review of permits, of exemptions or of approvals previously granted under the Code. The Committee shares the court’s view on this point, too, and recommends that Chapter 24, Section 7 be supplemented as the court proposes. This paragraph specifies the conditions under which matters concerning the review or withdrawal of a permit or concerning injunctions against continued operations may be heard. The Environment Court may not raise matters on its own initiative; under the provision, only certain agencies have the right to plead in court. The first paragraph of the section specifies that this applies to the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency, the Swedish Legal, Financial and Administrative Services Agency, the county administrative board concerned and the municipality that has taken over supervisory responsibility in cases specified there. Thus the Committee proposes that the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority be added to the list of agencies.</p>
<p>Conditions of importance for radiation safety</p>
<p>As regards any conditions relating to radiation safety issues that may be appropriate following the Government’s assessment of permissibility, the Committee takes the view that the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority as an expert body is best qualified to issue them.</p>
<p>In light of this, the Committee proposes that a new rule be added to Chapter 22, Section 25 of the Environmental Code stating that in cases concerning radiation safety as described in Chapter 12, the Environment Court is to delegate responsibility for establishing conditions of importance for radiation safety to the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority.</p>
<p>In addition, the Committee proposes that a reference to its proposals under Chapter 12, Sections 15–16 be inserted into this section. Under these provisions, the Government is required to issue regulations to the effect that permission or approval as prescribed in this Chapter is to be subject to the conditions necessary to ensure compliance with 1. the responsibilities and obligations that follow from the Act on Liability and Compensation in the Event of Radiological Accidents, and 2. the requirements concerning the supply of ores, source materials and special fissile materials that follow from the provisions in the treaty of 25 March 1957 on the establishment of the European Atomic Energy Community.</p>
<p>In addition, under the Committee’s proposals, the Government is to issue regulations to the effect that the agency it appoints is given the task of stipulating the conditions needed for radiation safety purposes during the licence permit’s period of validity. These conditions may not, however, involve any alteration of the conditions issued by the Environment Court.</p>
<p>The Committee’s proposals in relation to current regulations</p>
<p>Diagrammatically, the present application process for the erection of new facilities for nuclear activities under the Environmental Code and the Nuclear Operations Act is as follows:</p>
<p>In sum, the Committee’s proposals for a single harmonised application process mean simplifying the rules in relation to those currently found in the Environmental Code and the Nuclear Operations Act. In principle, however, the process itself will differ little from the present one.</p>
<p>The Committee’s proposals for incorporating the substantive rules in the Radiation Protection Act and the Nuclear Operations Act into the Environmental Code will mean that - the Nuclear Operations Act and the Radiation Protection Act will cease to apply, which in turn means the Government will no longer be required to assess permit applications as at present, - applicants need only draw up a permit application for submission to the Environment Court, - the Government’s permissibility assessments and the Environment Court’ licence assessments will only cover major new facilities where nuclear operations are planned, unless the Government decides in certain individual cases that other facilities also require a permissibility assessment, - the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority is empowered to examine the radiation safety aspects in preparing the Government’s permissibility assessment, - the Government’s decision on permissibility will be binding on the Environment Court, as is currently the case, - the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority’s powers under the Environmental Code will be strengthened, e.g. in that the agency will be able to plead in court when application cases are dealt with under the Code, - the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority will be empowered to stipulate the conditions under which permission may be granted in cases that have a bearing on nuclear safety, - the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority will, to a greater extent than at present, consider permit applications for facilities of a less hazardous nature.</p>
<p>In brief, the revised process for dealing with applications for new nuclear facilities may be described as follows:</p>
<h2>The Applicant</h2>
<p>Prepares a permit application in accordance with the Environmental Code and submits it to the relevant environment court</p>
<h2>The Environment Court</h2>
<p>Sends a copy of the application both to the Radiation Safety Authority and to other agencies in accordance with the Environmental Code</p>
<h2>The Swedish Radiation Safety Authority</h2>
<p>Reviews the nuclear safety aspects</p>
<p>Stipulates conditions</p>
<p>Submits a statement of opinion to the environment court, the municipal council and the Government.</p>
<p>Reviews in accordance with the Environmental Code, holds the main hearing</p>
<p>Considers the matter in accordance with the Environmental Code Sends its statement of opinion to the Government</p>
<h2>The Municipality</h2>
<p>Approves or rejects the operations</p>
<h2>The Government</h2>
<p>Grants permits under the Environmental Code</p>
<p>Holds new main hearing</p>
<p>Grants permits and stipulates conditions pursuant to the Environmental Code.</p>
<p>May delegate responsibility for stipulating safety conditions to the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority</p>
<p>Stipulates the conditions and announces them in stages</p>
<h2>Radioactive waste</h2>
<p>Recycling and reuse in respect of radioactive waste</p>
<p>The Environmental Code incorporates legally binding principles and general rules of consideration. Anyone pursuing an activity under the Code is required for instance to conserve raw materials and energy and to reuse and recycle them wherever possible, i.e. to respect both the resource management principle and the ecocycle principle.</p>
<p>The resource management principle implies that all activities are to be pursued and all measures taken in such a way that raw materials and energy are used as efficiently as possible.</p>
<p>The ecocycle principle implies that materials sustainably extracted from nature are used, reused, recycled and disposed of with the least possible usage of resources and without detriment to the natural environment. Alternatively, this principle might be described as the pursuit of circular or closed flows of materials.</p>
<p>The Committee cannot see any sound reason why the principles of sound management and natural cycles should not be fully applied in the case of radioactive waste, since there is nothing specific to suggest that this might have an adverse effect on human health or the human environment. This is particularly true of lowlevel radioactive waste deposited in ground facilities at Sweden’s nuclear power stations and at the Studsvik research plant.</p>
<p>Incineration as a means of reducing waste volumes may also be a desirable development.</p>
<p>From a safety viewpoint, on the other hand, and in view of the proliferation risk, questions have been raised about the advisability of exploiting what energy remains in spent nuclear fuel through processing. However, the Committee sees no reason to deviate from the position previously adopted on this issue by the Riksdag (parliament), namely that there is no legal justification for prohibiting processing since a ban on one particular method of managing spent nuclear fuel could lead to other methods that might subsequently prove to be less well-founded.</p>
<p>The Committee is aware, however, that at the present time direct disposal of radioactive waste is much cheaper than waste treatment for recycling and reuse. As long as the economic gap between direct disposal and alternative treatment methods persists, there is little prospect of a change in strategy on the part of licence holders.</p>
<p>The term ‘nuclear waste’ is removed</p>
<p>The Committee perceives little point in the legislative distinction between nuclear waste and radioactive waste, and therefore proposes that the term nuclear waste not be included in the new law. Instead, all radioactive waste deriving from nuclear operations or other practices involving radiation is defined as radioactive waste. The Committee proposes, however, that the term nuclear fuel be retained. , partly because it is well established internationally and partly because of the safeguard management aspect. Also, the Swedish definition of radioactive waste explicitly corresponds to the internationally accepted definition.</p>
<p>Management and final disposal of non-nuclear radioactive waste</p>
<p>Most of the radioactive waste in Sweden is dealt with at the Studsvik facility on behalf of the party that generated it. In this connection, once the permit application has been approved by the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority, the original waste operator hands over responsibility for the final treatment and disposal of the waste to Studsvik Nuclear AB.</p>
<p>By means of a civil law agreement between Studsvik Nuclear AB and the Swedish Nuclear Fuel and Waste Management Company (SKB), Studsvik is assured of final disposal capacity at the SFR repository in Forsmark. The Radiation Safety Authority takes the view that the contracted volume of 7 000 barrel equivalents is enough to accommodate non-nuclear radioactive waste from the Studsvik facility. In light of this, the Committee finds that at present no specific action is required on the part of central government, e.g. trying to reach an agreement between the Swedish state and SKB to secure the final disposal of non-nuclear radioactive waste. This, however, presupposes that the content of the current agreement between Studsvik Nuclear AB and SKB relating to final disposal is not renegotiated.</p>
<p>Regarding the partially unsatisfactory situation that has arisen in which some holders of radioactive waste are said to lack the financial means to dispatch their waste for treatment and final disposal via Studsvik Nuclear AB, the Committee has been unable to find any solution other than the one prescribed in current legislation, namely that the party possessing waste is responsible for ensuring its final disposal. This follows from the proposals regarding Chapter 12, Sections 23 and 24 of the Environmental Code. The holder is also required to defray the cost of disposing of the radioactive waste generated in the operation.</p>
<p>Chapter 16, Section 3, first paragraph of the Environmental Code also prescribes that the validity of permits, approvals and exemptions may be made subject to the requirement that security is furnished for the costs involved in this connection. The operation concerned may not be launched unless this requirement is met.</p>
<p>The dumping of radioactive waste at sea</p>
<p>In the course of the inquiry, the question has arisen whether dumping – as the term is defined in the international conventions – may also apply to the final disposal of radioactive waste in special repositories beneath the sea bed. Based on the definitions laid down in the conventions to which Sweden is a party, the Committee takes the view that the final disposal beneath the sea bed of radioactive waste in special repositories connected to land is not to be regarded as dumping.</p>
<h2>Exemptions</h2>
<p>The legal definition of practices involving radiation means that Chapter 12 of the Environmental Code could have an extremely wide area of application. Everything in our environment emits radiation in one way or another.</p>
<p>To avoid establishing an overly wide and complicated area of application, it will be necessary, as in the case of the current provisions in the Radiation Protection Act, to limit the scope of Chapter 12 so that it deals only with protection against the harmful effects of radiation.</p>
<p>Pursuant to the Government’s authorisation, the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority has both issued regulations on exemptions – known as clearance regulations based on established limit values/clearance levels – and granted exemptions in individual cases.</p>
<p>One of the aims of the inquiry is to raise basic radiation safety principles from the level of agency rule to that of a law or ordinance. Provisions on exemptions from the area of application described in Chapter 12 are one example of the types of basic rules that in the Committee’s view should be brought together in an ordinance.</p>
<h2>The state’s responsibility of last resort for the final disposal of spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste</h2>
<p>The Committee proposes that a legal provision be introduced regulating the state’s responsibility of last resort for spent nuclear fuel. Such a legislative measure has a number of advantages. By ratifying the 1997 Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management (the Waste Convention), the Swedish state has accepted ultimate responsibility for ensuring safety. The legal provision proposed by the Committee makes clear the state’s responsibility in this respect. Such a provision can enhance security for the actors involved, such as the municipality in which the fuel is to be disposed of, its inhabitants, property owners and also the power industry. Systematic government supervision eliminates the risk that the licence holder may lose the motivation to assume responsibility for solving the question of final disposal, as required by law.</p>
<p>A state takeover of rights and obligations in the absence of a licence holder who can be held accountable would require careful consideration of the civil law implications with regard to ownership of the spent fuel. The Committee has also addressed issues associated with the property on which the final repository is situated, asking what might happen should the owning company go bankrupt or be liquidated. Its conclusion is that the property should preferably pass to the state if the licence holder were to cease to exist. In this connection, the Committee notes that Chapter 2, Section 5 of the Swedish Expropriation Act (1972:719) would allow the state to take over the property.</p>
<p>An expropriation procedure may only be embarked upon, however, if the company owning the land on which the final repository for spent fuel is situated is in the process of being dissolved through liquidation or bankruptcy. These are the only circumstances under which expropriation is possible, given the constitutional division of responsibilities established between the state and reactor owners. Thus while the companies remain active the state has no right to expropriate the land.</p>
<h2>Supervision of the radiation safety sphere</h2>
<p>General observations</p>
<p>Having reviewed how supervisory duties are discharged in the radiation safety sphere, the Committee is in a position to make some general observations.</p>
<p>The Swedish Radiation Safety Authority reports that its inspections of the health and medical care service have revealed poor compliance with the rules on the training of local staff, particularly doctors, in radiation protection and the handling of Xray equipment. Other common failings include a lack of or incomplete method descriptions, inadequate follow-up of patients given radiotherapy, and insufficient reporting of work methods, as a result of which patient safety cannot be guaranteed. The Swedish Radiation Safety Authority is of the opinion that these failings are largely due to roles and responsibilities not being properly defined within the licence holder’s organisation.</p>
<p>Particularly in the case of activities in the health and medical care service, and of technical appliances and radiation sources in industry and research, it would appear that inspections need to be stepped up so as to remedy the shortcomings identified by the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority.</p>
<p>During the period 2006–2008, for instance, a total of five inspections were carried out among 1 830 licence holders possessing technical appliances. The agency attribute this low rate of inspection to a lack of resources, implementation of the HASS Directive and the licensing requirement for existing radiation sources in Sweden.</p>
<p>The agency also has plans to provide inspections at set intervals, e.g. in the laser and health and medical care spheres. Each year, one or two county councils are inspected. Adjusted for the size of care providers, this means that the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority is able to inspect each individual provider about every 20 years. In addition, a number of minor inspections governed by events are undertaken, as well as minor inspections focusing on only a small part of a given operation .</p>
<p>Regarding dental X-ray diagnosis, the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority reports that it lacks systematic instruments for fully assessing compliance with laws and regulations in this sphere. The large number of activities involved, along with their broad geographical spread, means that conventional inspections are unrealistic in practical terms, although the extent of such activities means it is important to ensure proper control. The agency intends therefore to discharge its supervisory duties via reviews, licensing and communication.</p>
<p>In light of the above, the Committee feels there may be cause to reflect on how the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority’s rate of inspection might be stepped up in certain areas of activity. The rate of inspection depends to a great extent on the proportion of time the relevant staff set aside for such duties, but also and above all on whether enough resources are available in relation to the agency’s task.</p>
<p>Supervision under the Environmental Code</p>
<p>As of 1 March 2011, the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority is responsible for operational supervision under the Environmental Code in matters relating to ionising and non-ionising radiation, i.e. nuclear operations under the Nuclear Operations Act and practices involving radiation under the Radiation Protection Act. The agency already has prime responsibility under the Environmental Code for supervising practices relating to ionising and non-ionising radiation.</p>
<p>The bodies responsible for supervisory duties are set out in the Ordinance on Environmental Inspections (2011:13).</p>
<p>The Environmental Code’ supervisory regulations set out in Chapter 26 are complete in that, as in the case of the Nuclear Operations Act and the Radiation Protection Act, they serve to support the supervisory authority in its efforts to ensure compliance with the rules on radiation safety.</p>
<p>The agency is required to adopt appropriate measures to rectify irregularities in operations. Supervisory authorities are also required to continually check whether the stipulated conditions governing an activity are sufficient, given radiation safety considerations and the general aims of the Environmental Code.</p>
<p>The supervisory authority is empowered to issue whatever orders may be necessary in individual cases, and these may be combined with a conditional financial penalty. Decisions prohibiting a particular operation or measure may also be taken where necessary.</p>
<p>In addition, supervisory authorities can take action against anyone engaging in a practice involving radiation without permission.</p>
<p>The supervisory authority may order anyone engaging in operations or taking measures covered either by the Environmental Code or by regulations based on the Code, to submit whatever information and documents that body may require in the performance of its duties. The same applies to whoever may be otherwise obliged to deal with the negative effects of such operations or measures.</p>
<p>The supervisory authority is also able to demand investigations and similar types of inquiry on the part of the operator if this is deemed necessary to ensure proper supervision. Such a requirement may for instance involve samples being taken, inquiries being made or investigations being launched.</p>
<p>A supervisory authority may decide that its decision is to take immediate effect even if an appeal is lodged against it.</p>
<p>In order to accomplish its task, a supervisory authority has the right to demand access to property, buildings, other facilities and means of transport. It also has the right to carry out whatever investigations and take whatever measures it deems necessary for the proper performance of its supervisory duties. This right of access further applies to anyone acting on the supervisory authority’s behalf, e.g. an expert charged with inspecting a facility or engaging in some other form of investigation prior to a decision by the authority.</p>
<p>The Committee finds that only a few minor additions are required to the provisions in Chapter 26 of the Environmental Code if the radiation safety aspect is incorporated into Chapter 12. - Chapter 26, Section 1  needs to be supplemented by a reference to practices involving radiation, if substantive radiation safety provisions are incorporated into Chapter 12 of the Environmental Code. - Chapter 26, Section 3  needs to be supplemented by a reference to the Radiation Safety Authority being the supervisory body for practices involving radiation. - Chapter 26, Section 20  needs to be supplemented by a reference to the permit requirement as prescribed in Chapter 12, Section 5. - Chapter 26, Section 27  needs to be supplemented by a reference to conditions of importance for national security.</p>
<p>Nuclear power accounts for a significant share of Sweden’s power supply and is therefore deemed to impact on the country’s total defence system. Consequently, activities involving the country’s nuclear power reactors have a bearing on national security and are covered by the provisions set forth in the Security Protection Act (1996:627). Security protection refers partly to protection against espionage, sabotage and other crimes that may constitute a threat to national security, partly in other cases to the protection of information covered by the secrecy provisions in the Public Access and Secrecy Act (2009:400) relating to national security, and partly to protection against terrorism pursuant to Section 2 of the Act on Criminal Responsibility for Terrorist Offences (2003:148), even where such offences do not threaten national security.</p>
<p>Clearer supervisory responsibility within the framework of the Work Environment Act, the Health and Medical Services Act, and the Medical Devices Act</p>
<p>Besides the Radiation Protection Act, provisions concerning radiation safety are also to be found in the Work Environment Act, the Health and Medical Services Act and the Medical Devices Act.</p>
<p>Four different agencies are responsible for supervising their respective spheres of activity where radiation also affects staff, patients and the general public, namely the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority, the Swedish Work Environment Authority, the National Board of Health and Welfare and the Medical Products Agency.</p>
<p>The relevant laws – the Work Environment Act, the Health and Medical Services Act and the Medical Devices Act – along with the new Chapter 12 of the Environmental Code as proposed by the Committee, apply in parallel.</p>
<p>Without changing the allocation of supervisory responsibilities or the current division of labour among the agencies involved, the Committee believes the responsibility for supervising radiation safety should be made clearer. This can be achieved by inserting text into each law giving priority to the radiation protection provisions wherever protection against radiation is dealt with in that policy area. Accordingly, the Committee proposes that the Work Environment Act, the Health and Medical Services Act and the Medical Devices Act be supplemented by an annotation making clear that where radiation protection is concerned the provisions in Chapter 12 of the Environmental Code apply.</p>
<p>As at present, this means the provisions on radiation safety in the Environmental Code should apply alongside the Work Environment Act, the Health and Medical Services Act and the Medical Devices Act. Thus the aim is for the four laws to be fully applicable in parallel. The Committee’s proposal in this respect means that radiation protection regulations or conditions stipulated on the basis of the Radiation Protection Act should be established by the Swedish Work Environment Authority, the National Board of Health and Welfare and the Medical Products Agency as a basis for their assessments and be regarded as a minimum requirement that must be met in all circumstances.</p>
<p>This proposal would ensure that responsibility for overall radiation protection was more clearly established in law. Besides the desire for a clearer division of responsibilities, one of the basic reasons for this proposal is that radiation is a very broad term and the question of what shape protection against its harmful effects should take is one that requires a considerable degree of expertise to answer. The Swedish Radiation Safety Authority possesses such expertise within its organisation. Another reason is that the EU’s basic security standards for protecting the health of the general public, patients and employees against the risks posed by ionising radiation are currently being revised. The new rules are expected to be more wide-ranging than those currently in effect pursuant to Council Directive 96/29/Euratom of 13 May 1996. Without making any fundamental changes in the division of labour that now applies, the priority accorded the provisions on radiation protection should be annotated in each respective law in the manner proposed by the Committee.</p>
<p>Naturally, it is important to continue striving for integration of the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority’s regulations and general advice concerning radiation with the regulations and advice issued on the basis of the Work Environment Act, the Health and Medical Services Act and the Medical Devices Act.</p>
<h2>Emergency preparedness in the event of a release of radioactive material</h2>
<p>Responsibility for preparedness for accidents and incidents in Sweden involving radioactive material is shared among a large number of actors, including government agencies, county administrative boards and municipalities.</p>
<p>Responsibility in the case of government agencies is defined in existing laws and ordinances and translated into practical measures and contingency plans setting out procedures to be followed independently or in collaboration with other bodies in the event of an emergency. Plans and preparations are tested regularly in planned emergency exercises and lessons learned are translated into measures designed to improve their performance and effectiveness.</p>
<p>To ensure that agencies are alerted promptly when an accident occurs, and that a response is initiated as soon as possible after an alarm is triggered, agencies have officers on 24-hour standby. Standby officers receive alarms and are normally authorised to make critical decisions on their own initiative on behalf of their agency, concerning measures that are needed in the early stages of an accident before the relevant contingency organisations are assembled.</p>
<p>Swedish legislation has for many years required the establishment and maintenance of contingency planning, measures and organisations in the event of an accident at a nuclear power station or other radiological or nuclear emergency. Preparedness must span the entire threat spectrum, from minor incidents to a major breakdown at one of the country’s nuclear plants. In the Committee’s view, the laws and ordinances currently in force are sufficient for this purpose and there is at present no need for statutory amendments in this area.</p>
<h2>Direct access to operating data</h2>
<p>A party licensed to own and operate a nuclear power facility is required to implement measures designed to prevent the harmful effects of radiation and to mitigate the adverse effects of radiation exposure should an accident occur. In the event of an accident involving radiation contamination at a nuclear power plant, it is of crucial importance that rapid, reliable information be relayed from the licence holder to the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority, so that the authority can in turn provide guidance on and support for measures necessary to minimise the risk of injury to people and damage to the environment. Advice and/or support may for instance include advice to the emergency and rescue services coordinator in the immediate area, on the ingestion of iodine tablets, on evacuation measures or on grazing bans. In light of shortcomings with regard to the transfer of information identified by the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority in the course of emergency preparedness exercises, the Committee considers that the agency should be provided with more effective tools to enable it to carry out a rapid, reliable assessment of the status of a nuclear facility and provide a prognosis and impact assessment of a possible radioactive spill.</p>
<p>The ability of an agency to gain access to relevant data from a nuclear power plant in the event of an accident can be assured by requiring the automatic transfer of important plant data directly from the facility to the agency's emergency centre. This allows the agency to gain an immediate overview of the status of the facility and quickly make its own estimation of the source term. Source term assessment is an important prerequisite for conducting dispersion analyses and thereby guiding and advising the emergency and rescue services coordinator. Systems for the automatic transfer of data from a facility to a supervisory authority are already in use at a number of such bodies in other countries.</p>
<p>In light of the above, the Committee considers that there are grounds for proposing that a party licensed to own and operate a nuclear reactor be required to ensure that the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority has access to operating data from the reactor via direct data transfer. This will enable the agency to make rapid, wellfounded assessments aimed at minimising the harmful effects of radiation on people and the environment.</p>
<p>The Committee accordingly proposes that a new provision be included in Chapter 12, Section 22 of the Environmental Code to the effect that a party licensed to own and operate a nuclear reactor must ensure that the supervisory authority has direct access to operating data from the reactor where there is a risk of harmful effects from radiation in the event of a reactor breakdown or other such circumstance.</p>
<h2>Non-proliferation of nuclear material and technology</h2>
<p>The Committee proposes the introduction of a new law, the Control of Nuclear Material Act, to cover areas and activities currently within the purview of the Nuclear Operations Act and the International Inspections Act.</p>
<p>The provisions to be set out in the Control of Nuclear Material Act aim to ensure that Sweden honours its international nonproliferation commitments, primarily its undertakings under the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Sweden undertakes not to manufacture or store nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices, and to agree to international inspections. In addition, Sweden undertakes not to assist in or contribute to the acquisition of nuclear weapons by another country. This commitment is fulfilled primarily through export controls. Sweden is bound by UN resolutions in this sphere, in particular by Security Council Resolution 1540 (2004), which is mainly aimed at preventing the spread of weapons of mass destruction to non-state actors.</p>
<p>A law on the control of nuclear material would thus aim to ensure that Sweden meets its international commitments regarding disarmament and non-proliferation.</p>
<p>The Committee has not proceeded with proposals aimed at significantly extending existing provisions in the non-proliferation sphere, although it would be possible to do so. It may be mentioned, for instance, that UN Resolution 1540 (2004) provides inter alia  for the control of nuclear armament. Before such measures are transposed into Swedish law, however, it will be necessary to determine the best way to proceed and to assess the possible consequences. On the other hand, the Committee proposes that the ban set out in the 1996 Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT)be incorporated in Swedish legislation. The state parties to the CTBT undertake not to carry out any nuclear weapon test explosions or any other nuclear explosions. Sweden has ratified the treaty. However it has not yet entered into force. Despite this, the ban should be transposed into Swedish legislation as it contributes to international nuclear disarmament and nonproliferation efforts.</p>
<p>The advantage of a new, unifying law on the control of nuclear material is that parts of current legislation governing nonproliferation will be incorporated in one and the same act. This will make for greater clarity. Moreover a separate act on the control of nuclear material can be designed to resemble as far as possible other legislation aimed at preventing the spread of other weapons of mass destruction. Furthermore, such a law could be easily adapted to comply with parts of UN Security Council Resolution 1540 (2004) and/or other new, upcoming requirements in the nonproliferation sphere.</p>
<p>The Committee proposes in this connection a consequential amendment to Chapter 2, Section 3 of the Environmental Code.</p>
<h2>Use of cosmetic solariums</h2>
<p>The Radiation Safety Inquiry proposes that a new rule be inserted into Chapter 12 of the Environmental Code banning operators of commercially operated solariums equipped with devices that radiate ultraviolet light primarily for the purpose of tanning the skin (cosmetic solarium) from making these available to people under the age of 18.</p>
<p>The proposal is in line with recommendations issued by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), a UN/WHO body.</p>
<p>It also agrees with the proposal put forward in the report, A National Cancer Strategy for the Future (SOU 2009:11), as well as with recommendations issued by the Radiation Safety Authority’s Scientific Advisory Council and a number of international and national expert bodies.</p>
<p>Germany has a federal law prohibiting minors from using solariums for cosmetic tanning purposes.</p>
<h2>Use of lasers</h2>
<p>Some lasers are basically harmless, while others can cause lasting damage to the eyes. High-powered laser beams can also burn exposed skin. Thus, if carelessly handled, lasers can harm people and animals. Laser light is used in professional contexts such as medical treatment, in the measurement of air pollution and vehicle speed, and in cosmetic skin treatments. There are also laser pointers and laser shows used in advertising and for art and entertainment. Other devices, mainly for private use, include laser pointers, laser collimators and distance measurement equipment. They are often used by people with insufficient knowledge of the dangers associated with laser radiation.</p>
<p>The risk of injury from a laser beam depends on its strength, the distance between the laser and the person and how long the beam is trained on a given part of the body, the eye, for example.</p>
<p>Potentially dangerous, high-class lasers are becoming cheaper and therefore more common, although lower-powered lasers are often adequate for their intended purpose. More and more potentially dangerous higher-class lasers (>laser class 2m) are now coming onto the market, despite the fact that lower output lasers (laser classes 1, 1m, 2 and 2m) are usually strong enough for their intended purpose. They are often used by people with insufficient knowledge of the dangers associated with laser radiation.</p>
<p>Increased access to high-powered laser pointers (with outputs of over 100 mW) has been accompanied by more widespread abuse of these devices. According to the National Police Board , these are used to harass private persons, police officers and pilots etc. Laser beams can cause lasting eye damage, leading in some cases to blindness. If the driver of a road vehicle is dazzled by a laser beam, the result may be a serious accident.</p>
<p>The same problem is found throughout the European Economic Area (EEA). The radiation safety authorities in Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden accordingly proposed in a communication to the EU Commission on 3 November 201o that the Commission introduce common import restrictions on high-powered laser pointers. The communication also included a proposal to ban the use of excessively high-powered laser pointers by members of the public. According to the authorities, members of the public should only be allowed to use class 1 and 2 lasers (European standard EN 60825-1) with a maximum output of 1 mW.</p>
<p>The Committee shares the views of the Nordic radiation safety authorities regarding high-powered laser pointers and proposes that a clause be inserted into Chapter 12 of the Environmental Code banning the import or introduction into Sweden of pointers of class 3 B or 4 and otherwise prohibiting the possession, storage, sale, hire or conveyance of these items. However, it is proposed that the ban should not apply to professional use of laser pointers, e.g. for military purposes.</p>
<p>The Committee has also taken account of the regulations governing the issuance of permits for lasers, which it understands have been introduced in Germany and France. The Committee accordingly proposes that a clause be inserted into Chapter 12 of the Environmental Code requiring a party who introduces, imports, sells, hires or makes over lasers to classify and label them in accordance with Swedish standards. Parties should also be required to ensure that lasers are accompanied by instructions and warning notices indicating the precautions that must be taken when assembling and using the device in order to avoid injury or damage.</p>
<p>The market for cosmetic treatments is growing, along with the risk of damage or injury from these procedures. In addition, a new type of radiation, intense pulsed light (IPL) , with emissions as intense as laser light, has recently been developed. Research is lagging behind the application of these techniques, which are being introduced before we have had time to gain a scientific understanding of how they work and their possible long-term effects.</p>
<p>There are therefore compelling grounds in the Committee's view for strengthening and extending the permit requirement set out in the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority's regulations to include the possession and use of stronger class lasers as well as laser-based cosmetic treatment. The extended permit requirement should not however apply to the use of lasers in connection with medical or odontological treatment or examinations. Lasers used in connection with medical treatment constitute a medical device under the 1993 Medical Devices Act (1993:584). A medical device may be marketed provided it meets the requirements laid down in the act and in the regulations issued by the Medical Products Agency.</p>
<p>The Committee proposes that rules governing permit requirements be incorporated in the proposed Ordinance on Operations Involving Radiation instead of, as now, in the regulations issued by the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority.</p>
<p>The reason for the Committee’s recommendation that the proposed provisions be inserted in the Environmental Code and in the proposed Ordinance on Operations Involving Radiation is that failure to observe them should in the Committee’s view be punishable under Chapter 29, Section 1 on environmental crimes, or, alternatively, under Chapter 29, Section 4 on unauthorised activities detrimental to the environment.</p>
<h2>Punitive measures</h2>
<p>Penal provisions in the field of radiation safety are mainly found in the Nuclear Operations Act (1984:3), the Radiation Protection Act (1988:220) and the Environmental Code. The Environmental Code also applies – alongside the provisions in the Nuclear Operations Act and the Radiation Protection Act – to operations or activities involving ionising or non-ionising radiation. The penal provisions in the Code thus also apply to operations or activities in the sphere of radiation safety. A breach of radiation safety regulations is punishable both under the Code and the above two acts. For example, conducting an operation involving radiation without a licence is punishable both under Section 25 of the Nuclear Operations Act and Chapter 29, Section 4 of the Environmental Code.</p>
<p>The Committee finds that certain changes and additions should be made to the provisions in the Environmental Code if substantive radiation safety provisions are inserted into Chapter 12 of the Code.</p>
<p>The key penal provisions in the environmental criminal law sphere are set out in Chapter 29, Section 1 on environmental crimes. The offences are listed under four points in the first paragraph of Section 1. Point 3 is concerned with radiation. Point 1 in the same paragraph deals with deliberate pollution of land, water or air in a manner which involves or is liable to involve risks for human health or detriment to flora and fauna. The form of pollution is irrelevant; it makes no difference whether the polluting agent is emitted directly or for instance as a result of burning, warming or cooling. The proviso here is that the perpetrator shall have caused a substance to be leaked or emitted into the surrounding environment which typically or in the specific case in question results or could result in pollution involving considerable risks to human health or detriment to flora and fauna, or other significant detriment to the environment.</p>
<p>The word ‘caused’ should of course be understood to refer both to a deliberate action and to an unlawful failure to act, i.e. passivity, on the part of the offender.</p>
<p>The provisions relating to environmental crimes can already be applied to offences under the Nuclear Operations Act and the Radiation Protection Act. Under Point 3, a person who causes substantial detriment to the environment as a result inter alia of radiation, whether ionising or non-ionising, can be convicted of environmental crime. The Committee now proposes the addition to Chapter 29, Section 1 of a provision to the effect that a person found guilty of causing prohibited exposure to ionising or nonionising radiation detrimental to human, animal or plant health, or to the environment, shall be liable to conviction for environmental crime. Such an addition to Chapter 29, Section 1 – concerning unlawful exposure to ionising radiation – links more effectively to the interests of protecting people and the environment that the penal provisions are intended to safeguard.</p>
<p>The Committee further considers that the penal provisions in the Environmental Code should be supplemented by a new provision and a new crime classification, as follows: Chapter 29, Section 1a, Environmentally Hazardous Activities Involving Radiation. It is proposed that the provision be worded as follows:</p>
<p>A person who deliberately or through negligence engages in environmentally hazardous operations or activities shall be liable to a fine or a term of imprisonment not exceeding two years for 1. failure to comply with the obligation to adopt such measures as are necessary to maintain radiation safety in accordance with the provisions set forth in Chapter 12, Section 21, 2. failure to comply with the obligation to report a  near-accident in accordance with the provisions set forth in Chapter 12, Section 22, or to report information of significance to an assessment of the radiation risks associated with an operation, in accordance with the provisions set forth in Chapter 12, Section 30, 3. failure to comply with the obligation to dispose of waste from operations involving radiation, in accordance with Chapter 12, Section 23, 4. failure to comply with the obligation to pursue research and development activities in accordance with Chapter 12, Section 25, 5. failure to comply with the obligation to conduct regular overall assessments in accordance with Chapter 12, Section 27.</p>
<p>No penalty shall be imposed under this Section if the offence is punishable under Section 1 or Section 9.</p>
<p>This provision is partly a clarification of previous provisions in the Nuclear Operations Act and Section 36 of the Radiation Protection Act. Point 4 would replace Section 15 of the Nuclear Operations Act, under which a licence could be revoked if the reactor owner had not undertaken prescribed research and development activities. Thus the – perhaps highly theoretical – possibility of having one’s operating licence revoked would be replaced by a penal provision.</p>
<p>The penal provisions in the Environmental Code should also be supplemented by a provision on unlawful operations or activities involving radiation: Chapter 29, Section 1b. It is proposed that the provision be worded as follows:</p>
<p>A person who deliberately or through negligence engages in unlawful operations or activities involving radiation shall be liable to a fine or a term of imprisonment not exceeding two years for 1. failure to observe the provision set forth in Chapter 12, Section 32 prohibiting the recommissioning of decommissioned reactors, 2. failure to observe the provision set forth in Chapter 12, Section 33 prohibiting the designation of a beneficiary of insurance coverage against damage to building elements, systems, components and facilities of significance to radiation safety in operations or activities involving radiation, other than the licence holder, 3. failure to observe the provision of mandatory classification or labelling of lasers set forth in Chapter 12, Section 34, 4. failure to observe the provision set forth in Chapter 12, Section 35 prohibiting the importing or introduction into Sweden, possession, manufacture, use, storage, sale, hire or conveyance of laser pointers of laser class 3R, 3B or 4, 5. failure to observe the provision prohibiting the employment of persons under the age of 18 in work or activities associated with ionising radiation set forth in Chapter 12, Section 36, 6. failure to observe the provision set forth in Chapter 12, Section 37 prohibiting the commercial hire of solariums for the purpose of cosmetic tanning to persons under the age of 18.</p>
<p>Point 3 in paragraph 1 applies only to the commercial use of lasers.</p>
<p>This provision may also be said to constitute a partial clarification of the corresponding penal provisions in Section 25 of the Nuclear Operations Act and Section 36 of the Radiation Protection Act.</p>
<p>A penal provision incorporated in a special section of the Code (Chapter 29, Section 1d) imposes a fine on persons who deliberately or through gross negligence contravene Council Regulation (Euratom) No. 2587/1999 of 2 December 1999 specifying the types of investment project to be reported to the EU Commission. A corresponding provision exists in the Nuclear Operations Act.</p>
<p>Under Chapter 29, Section 4, a person who initiates or pursues an activity, or who implements a measure without permission or authorisation, or without having submitted notification as required by the provisions set forth in the Code shall be liable to conviction for unauthorised activities detrimental to the environment. It is proposed that this Section be supplemented by a provision designed to make it applicable to the new Chapter 12 on radiation safety.</p>
<p>In addition to the penal provisions mooted above, the Committee proposes a number of other changes and additions, including a clause to the effect that a person who neglects to provide requisite data in the event of a near-accident, threat or similar circumstance be liable to a fine or a term of imprisonment not exceeding two years for obstruction of environmental control.</p>
<h2>Environmental sanction charges</h2>
<p>The Committee has also concluded that a system of environmental sanction charges should be introduced in the radiation safety sphere. Actions liable to sanctions would include less serious infringements for which the application of penal provisions would appear unnecessary. On the basis of the proposed ordinance on operations involving radiation, the Committee considers that a system of environmental sanction charges could be meaningful with regard to infringements of certain provisions therein, as discussed below. Adoption of the Committee’s proposals would mean that legal action could be taken against such infringements without the need to involve the police or prosecution service.</p>
<p>The Committee proposes that the rules on environmental sanction charges set out in Chapter 30 of the Environmental Code also apply in the radiation safety sphere. An important reason for this is that the system described in Chapter 30 of the Code is both simple and easy to apply. Another reason is that the sanction charges specified in the Code already apply to certain activities involving radiation. The system is simple and clear. Implementation can easily be standardised and cases can be processed quickly.</p>
<p>The Committee accordingly proposes that the Environmental Sanction Charges Ordinance (1998:1950) be supplemented by provisions governing activities or operations involving radiation.</p>
<p>The regulations issued by the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority contain a large number of provisions concerning the obligation to inform and report, etc. These should be eminently suitable as a platform for sanction charges. However, the Committee has not been able, in the time available to it, to analyse the provisions contained in the regulations. It therefore proposes that the Radiation Safety Authority itself undertake a thorough examination of its regulations so that careful consideration can be given to the possibility of introducing a system in which criminal liability is attributed through reference to other legislation..</p>
<h2>Public inspection in the radiation safety sphere – local safety committees</h2>
<p>Local safety committees should be retained but reformed</p>
<p>Although a number of shortcomings with respect to the operations of local safety committees have been noted, the Committee considers that there are still solid grounds for retaining them. The role of the committees as representatives of the public in matters concerning both radiation safety and contingency planning and preparedness is an important one, and when the committees function as intended, their work should generate greater transparency and facilitate public insight in this area. In the Committee’s view local interaction and support are important as they enable the rapid identification of questions nearby residents may have on ongoing operations.</p>
<p>In the Committee’s view, government-appointed local safety committees should be retained at facilities that handle nuclear material and where there could be a risk that such operations might cause problems for people’s health and the environment as a result of radiation exposure.</p>
<p>With regard to the local safety committee at the Barsebäck nuclear reactor, the Committee notes that all nuclear material in the form of spent nuclear fuel has been removed from the reactor site. As there is no longer a significant radiation source at Barsebäck and thus no tangible risk of a radiation spill, there are no further grounds for a safety committee on the site. The Committee therefore proposes that the local safety committee at the Barsebäck nuclear facility be wound down.</p>
<p>Safety committee catchment areas should be extended</p>
<p>In the Committee’s view, safety committee catchment areas should be extended. Information on radiation safety and contingency planning is not just of importance to residents of the municipality in which nuclear facilities are located. These issues are also of concern to surrounding municipalities.</p>
<p>Safety committees should be open to other actors</p>
<p>The Committee further recommends that safety committees be opened to actors other than political representatives. The proposal to geographically extend the safety committees’ catchment areas will also entail a broader recruitment base. Committees can benefit from the potentially valuable skills associated with municipal undertakings on safety issues through bodies such as the Emergency and Rescue Services. Representatives of local advocacy groups and grassroots organisations such as environmental and other organisations could also be appointed by the Government as committee members on the same basis as other members. The existing arrangement under which committee members are proposed for appointment by the municipality concerned, as well as the requirement that they be residents of the municipality that proposed them, should be discontinued.</p>
<p>Safety committees currently comprise a maximum of 13 members plus alternates. In the Committee’s view, such a large number is difficult to justify given the relatively limited extent of the task involved. Nor, in the Committee’s opinion, is there any real necessity for alternate members. At the same time it is also important, in view of the nature of the task, to ensure that the number of members is not too small. The Committee’s overall assessment is that nine members is a suitable number.</p>
<p>The safety committees’ information tasks</p>
<p>The Committee wishes to particularly emphasise that the safety committees’ inspection tasks involve more than just passing on information from ‘their’ nuclear facility. The committees’ role as information processers should therefore be strengthened. If safety committees are to be perceived as credible, they must, in the Committee's assessment, process the data they receive before passing it on to the public. Similarly, their assignment should include informing the public of the questions they have put to the power company and the answers the company has given. By welcoming questions from the community and bringing them to public notice, the committees can encourage interest in their work and in radiation safety and emergency preparedness issues in the municipalities concerned.</p>
<p>The role of the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority</p>
<p>The Committee’s assessment is that the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority should play a more clearly defined, stronger role in the safety committees. Representatives of the authority, as well as of the county administrative boards, should be present at safety committee meetings in order to report on radiation safety and emergency preparedness work at relevant nuclear facilities, inspection outcomes and follow-up activities. These authorities should assist the safety committees with locally relevant information regarding inspections undertaken, and ensure that the information prepared by the committees on radiation safety, contingency planning, possible deficiencies and measures is fair and balanced.</p>
<p>As part of the process of strengthening the role of the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority in the local safety committees, the latter should, in the Committee’s assessment, be formally required to apprise and inform the authority if it discovers evidence of or receives information regarding deficiencies in radiation safety in the facility concerned. By the same token, the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority should be required to inform the relevant committee if in the course of its inspections it discovers similar shortcomings.</p>
<p>Financial follow-up requirement</p>
<p>Although allocations to local safety committees are relatively modest, the Committee emphasises the importance of financial management and follow-up of their operations. In the Committee’s view, there are no grounds for continuing to exempt safety committees from external audits. Like all other government bodies, the committees should be required to submit annual reports and accounts as well as activity reports.</p>
<p>Financing</p>
<p>In the Committee’s view, continuing to finance the safety committees’ activities from charges levied on power companies under the ordinance governing charges by the Radiation Safety Authority, rather than via the authority’s research appropriation, would appear to be the most logical approach.</p>
<p>Credibility problems</p>
<p>The Committee's point of departure is that by extending each safety committee’s catchment area and recruitment base to include representatives of local interest organisations, strengthening Radiation Safety Authority participation in the committees’ work, and requiring committees to be externally audited, the latter will operate satisfactorily and their credibility will be significantly enhanced.</p>
<p>These measures, combined with coherent management based on a new set of instructions for the safety committees should, in the Committee’s view, be sufficient to restore confidence in the committees’ operations.</p>
<p>A new organisation</p>
<p>In summary, the Committee proposes that the operations of the existing local safety committees be extended in accordance with the above recommendations. To highlight what is in part a new direction for the committees’ operations, the Committee proposes that in future the committees be known as ‘local insight boards’. It is proposed that the following local inspection boards be established: - Local Insight Board at Ringhals Nuclear Power Plant - Local Insight Board at Oskarshamn Nuclear Power Plant - Local Insight Board at the Studsvik Processing Facility - Local Insight Board at Forsmark Nuclear Power Plant, and - Local Insight Board at the Nuclear Fuel Facility in Västerås.</p>
<h2>Examination of licence holders’ quality assurance programmes for the manufacture and delivery of materials, equipment, components and services of importance for radiation safety</h2>
<p>In the Committee’s view, it would be valuable if, like other equivalent authorities around the world, the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority were able to undertake inspections at the manufacturing stage of an important device or component intended to be installed in in a large, complex facility in the radiation safety sphere. However, there are formidable legal difficulties associated with a more robust inspection mandate for the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority. The Committee has accordingly outlined a possible model in which the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority is not actually given a mandate to inspect manufacturers and suppliers as well, but one in which the authority can ensure that the aims of a normal inspection regime are met.</p>
<p>An important premise here is that it is the licence holder’s responsibility to ensure that the quality of a product ordered for installation in a large, complex facility in the radiation safety sphere is of a sufficiently high standard for the purpose intended. If a licence holder does not devote enough attention to the quality assurance process, the product ordered may not come up to the prescribed standard. The authority’s inspection efforts should therefore be focused narrowly on the licence holder’s ability to implement sound procurement practices and carry out the necessary quality controls. Errors or deficiencies found in the course of an examination of a supplier or manufacturer are evidence that the licence holder’s approach to quality control has not been sufficiently rigorous. Thus, with no immediate prospect of direct inspection of suppliers or manufacturers, the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority’s supervisory role is limited to examining the licence holder’s quality assurance regime and the extent to which it is put into practice by suppliers. This also means that visits by the authority to a supplier’s or manufacturer’s premises are never unaccompanied but must be conducted in the presence of the licence holder or of an applicant for a licence. Nor must the authority communicate directly with suppliers or manufacturers other than to obtain information on the extent to which the licence holder's quality assurance measures have been put into practice. If the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority has views on work being carried out by a supplier or manufacturer, these are to be conveyed exclusively to the licence holder.</p>
<p>In the Committee’s view, limiting the scope of inspection to the narrow targeting of the licence holders’ quality assurance measures will ensure that the proposed model cannot be perceived as an exercise of official authority against a supplier or manufacturer, many of whom operate outside Sweden's borders.</p>
<p>The Committee accordingly proposes that a provision be inserted in Chapter 12, Section 27 of the Environmental Code authorising the supervisory authority to access and inspect licence holders’ quality assurance programmes during the manufacture and delivery of materials, equipment, components, and services of significance to radiation safety in facilities for nuclear operations.</p>
<h2>REGULATORY IMPACT ASSESSMENT</h2>
<p>The impact on individuals</p>
<p>The consequences of achieving the environmental quality objective, A Safe Radiation Environment, are discussed in Section 19.9 of the report.</p>
<p>Otherwise, individuals will be affected mainly by the Committee’s proposal to ban people under the age of 18 from using commercial solariums for the purpose of cosmetic tanning, and by the proposal to introduce a permit requirement for the possession and use of the strongest laser pointers. The Committee considers that these proposals will have significant benefits from a health perspective.</p>
<p>The proposal to reform and extend the scope of local safety committees should enable these to fulfil their role as representatives of the public in radiation safety and emergency preparedness matters more effectively.</p>
<p>The proposal to introduce legislation giving the state responsibility of last resort for spent nuclear fuel should mean greater security for individuals residing in municipalities that dispose of spent nuclear fuel.</p>
<p>The impact on companies</p>
<p>The companies most affected by radiation safety regulations are nuclear power companies. The Committee’s proposals will mean the disappearance of double processing, shorter decision-making processes in cases where decisions are taken at a lower level than previously, and clearer legislative provisions when the regulations currently contained in three separate acts are merged into a single law. On the other hand, the obligation to ensure the automatic transfer of operating data to the Radiation Safety Authority will constitute a new requirement, as will the broadening of the authority’s inspection mandate to include companies’ quality assurance measures in connection with the procurement of important components etc. On the whole, the Committee’s proposals should simplify matters for nuclear power companies.</p>
<p>As regards other businesses, those most affected by the Committee's proposals will be cosmetic solariums and companies that sell lasers.</p>
<p>The impact on municipalities</p>
<p>The ‘nuclear power municipalities’ will be the local government authorities most affected by the Committee's proposals. They should benefit from clearer legislation in the radiation safety sphere as well as from the enhanced supervisory powers conferred on the Radiation Safety Authority and its stronger role as an expert agency. Reform of local safety committees and their transformation into regional safety boards should also be beneficial.</p>
<p>The impact on the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority</p>
<p>The Committee’s proposals will mean a number of new tasks for the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority. The agency will be required to represent public radiation safety interests in cases brought before the environmental courts. It will also have new tasks to perform in connection with lasers and solariums. The agency will also have a clearer and stronger role in the new local insight boards. The inspection mandate will be broadened to include licence holders' quality assurance measures in connection with the procurement of important components etc. The agency will have better access to data, which will enable it to make rapid, reliable assessments of the status of a nuclear plant where there is an immediate risk of harmful radiation exposure as a result of a reactor breakdown or other similar circumstance, and to present a prognosis and impact assessment in the event of a radiation leak.</p>
<p>The Committee has not speculated on the extent to which the new tasks could result in an increase in the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority's resources. Any additional resources would – depending on how they were financed – either entail increased costs to the state or higher charges under the Ordinance concerning certain charges payable to the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority (2008:463).</p>
<p>The impact on the environmental courts</p>
<p>The Committee’s proposals could be of significance to the work of the environmental courts. On the one hand, government review of nuclear facilities will be limited to an assessment of permissibility.</p>
<p>On the other hand, licensing cases of a less complicated nature will be processed by the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority instead of the environmental courts. In cases involving radiation safety, the Environmental Court will also be able to delegate the task of establishing terms and conditions of importance for radiation safety to the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority. In the Committee’s view, its proposals will not have any appreciable effect on the workload of the environmental courts.</p>
<p>The impact on the environment</p>
<p>The aim of the environmental quality objective, A Safe Radiation Environment, is to ensure that human health and biological diversity are protected against harmful effects of radiation in the outdoor environment. Among other issues, the objective addresses the release of radioactive material from nuclear facilities or operations.</p>
<p>The Committee’s proposals will serve to strengthen the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority’s inspection mandate and its role as an expert body. The authority will have better access to data, which will enable it to make rapid, reliable assessments of the status of a nuclear plant where there is a risk of harmful radiation exposure as a result of a reactor breakdown or other similar circumstance, and to present a prognosis and impact assessment in the event of a radiation leak.</p>
<p>Significant health benefits should also be obtained as a result of the Committees’ proposal to ban the commercial use of solariums for cosmetic tanning by people under the age of 18. The proposal to classify and label lasers and the restrictions or prohibitions applying to the strongest laser pointers should also yield health benefits.</p>
