<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>The inquiry’s mission and points of departure</h2>
<p>The inquiry’s mission is to conduct a review of the entire admissions system for higher education courses and study programmes that begin at first-cycle level and are intended for new entrants. The inquiry is to provide proposals for a system that is more transparent and simpler.</p>
<p>The inquiry's points of departure state that upper-secondary school is to remain the main route into higher education, that there should be more routes into higher education and that the system should make lifelong learning possible. The admissions regulations must not exclude anyone who has the potential to complete higher education, they must ensure that only candidates who have the necessary knowledge for a study programme are considered eligible, and those who are best equipped to complete the course or study programme shall be admitted when a selection is needed. The regulations must also send out the right signals to upper-secondary school pupils. The admissions system has to be sustainable over time. In addition to these points of departure, the inquiry has decided on some additional points of departure for its work: the purpose of the admissions regulations is to settle matters concerning higher education admissions and they are to be grounded as far as possible in research. One of the problems with the current admissions regulations is that they contain provisions which exist solely to control the behaviour of upper-secondary school pupils and do not contribute to the admissions process. The stipulation that the proposals be grounded in research, where such is available, is a matter of quality. In addition to this, it has been important for the inquiry to examine what happens internationally in order to broaden its perspective in discussions concerning the design of a new system.</p>
<p>Another prerequisite for the inquiry was that the regulations must not make the admission of students an unduly complicated process and an excessive administrative burden for the authorities responsible.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>The two parts of the admissions system are entry requirements and selection. The entry requirements – “general” for all higher education and “specific” for individual programmes – stipulate the prior knowledge required. If it is not possible to admit all eligible applicants to a study programme, a selection is to be made. Entry requirements and selection thus have different functions in the system, but the two are often confused. The design of the admissions regulations, especially the selection system, sends out a strong signal and influences pupils in upper-secondary schools and the choices they make there. Similarly, upper-secondary school have an impact on admission to higher education institutions.</p>
<p>The current admissions regulations were introduced for admissions to the autumn semester of 2010. In addition to a tightening of general entry requirements and a reorganisation of the special entry requirements, credit increments were introduced. Credit increments were to be awarded for certain courses in mathematics and languages that the pupils had chosen in upper-secondary school as a supplement to the merit rating when making the selection. Credit increments were also awarded for certain courses that were of particular relevance to the course or study programme being applied for. The new admissions regulations also aimed to make it more difficult for applicants who had later supplemented their grades in municipal adult education in order to increase their merit rating. Since their introduction, the regulations have been amended on a number of occasions. The reasons for these amendments were that the upper-secondary school has changed and that the regulations concerning credit increments have gradually been introduced for all different groups of applicants who have grades. The admissions regulations have been criticised for being complex and confusing because of all the amendments and decisions that have involved various types of compensation for different groups of applicants.</p>
<p>Researchers have also questioned whether the applicants with the best chances of completing the course or study programme are being admitted when a selection needs to be made.</p>
<p>The admissions regulations need to take into account the qualifications of various groups of applicants. These qualifications vary depending on when the grades have been awarded and whether the grades are from a Swedish upper-secondary school or from another country. The majority of people who have previously fulfilled the general entry requirements must still be considered to have the same eligibility. Students therefore bring different prior knowledge with them to university as the general entry requirements have varied over time. At the same time, it is important to lifelong learning that previous decisions concerning general entry requirements remain valid.</p>
<p>Sweden has a uniform, nationally coordinated admissions system, which means that higher education institutions collectively decide how the provisions of the Swedish Higher Education Ordinance (1993:100) and the Swedish Council for Higher Education’s regulations are to be applied. It is important that admissions can be dealt with in a smooth manner, not least because of the high volume of applicants that higher education institutions have to process. Over 360,000 applicants to first-cycle courses and study programmes are processed in the shared system over the course of an autumn semester admissions’ round. In addition to this, there are applicants to second-cycle course and study programmes. There are a total of seven coordinated admissions rounds per year.</p>
<p>Very little research is conducted into admissions in Sweden. This is something the inquiry finds remarkable as the admissions regulations affect so many people and are an important part of the higher education institutions’ finances. Existing research, both domestic and international, reveals that, as an instrument of selection, grades are the most reliable means of predicting educational outcomes. But as a whole, the instruments of selection shed light on only a small part of educational outcomes.</p>
<p>The international perspective the inquiry gained has revealed that the entry requirements in other countries normally correspond to an upper-secondary qualification/school-leaving examination or the results of an entrance examination. It also thought to be relatively normal to have specific quotas or entry routes for older students and minorities, for example, with the aim of widening recruitment. With regard to selection, it seems to be more common for higher education institutions in other countries to have greater freedom to formulate their own selection criteria than Swedish institutions. Various types of entrance examination are often used, and various types of qualification are also taken into account.</p>
<h2>The inquiry’s assessment of what needs to be done</h2>
<p>In its considerations, the inquiry has come to the conclusion that it should be possible to make amendments to the admissions regulations within the existing framework of our current system. The inquiry believes the most important course of action to be to clear the system of elements which make today’s system complicated and confusing. One of its goals is to make the system simpler and more comprehensible. For this reason, a greater degree of simplicity has been a guiding principle when various aspects have needed to be taken into consideration. Elements that do not have a function directly linked to admissions to higher education should be removed. The regulations must be formulated in such a way that they are able to handle various groups of applicants with different types of qualification. There is also a need for clearer and simpler routes into higher education for people who do not have a traditional educational background. To avoid ending up with a system that needs to be patched and fixed in order to handle various groups of applicants and qualifications, changes in the world around us, etc., we need a system that is not overly static; a system that is able to cope with altered conditions and new groups in the future. This will increase the chances of making the system more sustainable over time. The guiding principles for the proposal have thus been simplicity, that admissions are to be safeguarded, that more entry routes provide more opportunities and that higher education institutions are to be incentivised to make admissions a strategic matter.</p>
<h2>The inquiry’s proposals</h2>
<p>The inquiry proposes that the new admissions regulations come into force in essence on 1 January 2022 and apply to courses and study programmes commencing after 31 July 2022.</p>
<p>The inquiry considers it important that the admissions regulations are evaluated and followed up. The Swedish Council for Higher Education should be tasked with evaluating the new admissions regulations when they are introduced and for some time thereafter. Such an evaluation should take into account the impact on universities and university colleges, upper-secondary schools, municipal adult education and applicants, among others. The Council should also get the mission to continuously following up various parts of the regulations.</p>
<h2>General entry requirements</h2>
<p>General entry requirements are currently defined through the Higher Education Ordinance (1993:100) stating how they can be achieved but not what they consist of, i.e. what is the lowest common denominator for the ability to benefit from a university education. The inquiry proposes that, instead, the general entry requirements be expressed in terms of competence. This would clearly set out what is required of applicants who are not taking the entry route from uppersecondary school. The various ways in which the relevant competence can be achieved also needs to be made clear and this should also be regulated in the Higher Education Ordinance. Of particular importance are competence in Swedish and English, academic approach, the capacity to highlight issues from several different perspectives, problem-solving ability, the ability to draw conclusions and make a case for these, and other competence that is necessary in order to benefit from higher education. The inquiry proposes that the Swedish Council for Higher Education issue more detailed regulations concerning the necessary competence.</p>
<p>An applicant with a university entrance qualification from uppersecondary school or municipal adult education (upper-secondary level) shall be considered to have met these competence requirements. The same applies to an applicant who has an upper-secondary vocational diploma from upper-secondary school or municipal adult education (upper-secondary level) and has passed the courses in Swedish or Swedish as a second language and English required for a university entrance qualification. Applicants with a Swedish or foreign education that is equivalent to the specified educational requirements will also be considered to have met the necessary competence requirements. The general entry requirements shall also be considered to be fulfilled by any resident of Denmark, Finland, Iceland or Norway who is eligible for admission to higher education there.</p>
<p>It is vital that we are able to effectively utilise the expertise of people with professional experience, other experience or education and thus facilitate lifelong learning. It is therefore necessary to have a regulation that makes it possible to meet the general entry requirements in ways other than through the current system of assessment of prior learning. The inquiry therefore proposes that a national entrance examination be introduced for those who do not meet the general entry requirements through upper-secondary education or equivalent. This entrance examination will test the individual’s expertise in the aforementioned areas. The inquiry proposes that the minimum age for taking the test be set to 24. The justification for a minimum age of 24 is that someone thus has a possibility of undergoing a three-year upper-secondary education, whether at uppersecondary school or within municipal adult education. The examination should be formulated in such a way that it can also give a merit rating so that those who are in the target group for the examination also have the opportunity to participate in a selection process with this qualification instead of simply being referred to the SweSAT. The entrance examination shall first be tested on a trial basis before a final decision is made. It is proposed that the trial take place in the period from autumn 2017 to 2024.</p>
<p>There will be people who, for one reason or another, choose not to take the entrance examination or who do not fulfil the minimum age requirement of 24 for taking the examination. These people will still have the opportunity to be assessed in relation to the general entry requirements based on their prior learning. In order to meet the general entry requirements on the basis of prior learning, the applicant will be required to have acquired the necessary expertise via education, practical experience or other circumstances.</p>
<p>Anyone who has previously been considered to meet the general entry requirements in accordance with older regulations shall still be considered to meet these requirements.</p>
<h2>Specific entry requirements</h2>
<p>The specific entry requirements that are set must be essential to the ability to benefit from the course or study programme. These requirements could also be of significance to the professional field for which the course or study programme prepares students. The inquiry proposes that the system of field-specific entry requirements be abolished as it has proved unsuitable and not to function optimally.</p>
<p>The inquiry proposes that the Swedish Council for Higher Education establish which specific entry requirements are to apply in terms of knowledge from courses from upper-secondary school for study programmes that begin at first-cycle leveland lead to a professional qualification. The Swedish Council for Higher Education also establishes the specific requirements for study programmes that lead to a qualification in the fine, applied and performing arts. Instead of requirements for knowledge obtained from courses from upper-secondary school, a higher education institution shall be able to stipulate for such programmes that a pass be achieved in an artistic entrance examination.</p>
<p>The inquiry also proposes that universities and university colleges establish the requirements for study programmes that lead to a general qualification and for freestanding courses. If higher education institutions are afforded greater freedom to establish the specific entry requirements, these can be more clearly based on the specific prior knowledge necessary for a certain course or study programme. To prevent these requirements being overly varied and so that uppersecondary schools and adult education institutions are aware of which courses need to be offered, there must be a number of identified potential courses from among which the higher education institutions are able to choose when they draw up their entry requirements. These courses should correspond to those that are currently included in the field-specific entry requirements and established by the Swedish Council for Higher Education. If higher education institutions wish to set requirements other than those established by the Swedish Council for Higher Education, they shall apply to the Swedish Council for Higher Education for permission to use other requirements. Such requirements may be knowledge obtained from courses or other conditions that are either necessary for the course or study programme or are of significance to the professional field for which the course or study programme prepares students. It should also be possible to fulfil the specific entry requirements through prior learning.</p>
<p>As is the case today, it should not be possible to set a grade requirement higher than an E (pass) as a specific entry requirement. The inquiry’s assessment is that it would be the wrong signal to send to upper-secondary school that grades considered a pass do not count towards entry into higher education. The requirement for a grade higher than E could result in pressure on teachers to award a grade that is higher than that merited by the pupil’s knowledge.</p>
<h2>Selection criteria and the allocation of places between different selection criteria</h2>
<p>It is proposed that grades and the SweSAT remain as general instruments of selection and that locally determined selection criteria be an option for higher education institutions. Based on the fact that for the majority of first-cycle courses and study programmes selection is not necessary or there is little competition for places, the inquiry’s assessment is that there is no need for additional general selection criteria. It must be up to each individual higher education institution to assess whether selection criteria are required in addition to grades and results of the SweSAT for their various courses and study programmes. The inquiry’s proposal means that most applicants to higher education have the opportunity to compete in at least two selection groups when selection is necessary.</p>
<p>When it is necessary to make a selection from among the eligible applicants, the majority of places shall be allocated on the basis of grades. At least 15 per cent of the places shall be allocated on the basis of the results of the SweSAT. Higher education institutions will also be able to choose to allocate places on the basis of locally determined selection criteria. Should a higher education institution wish to allocate a maximum proportion of places on the basis of locally determined selection criteria and the lowest possible proportion of places on the basis of the SweSAT the distribution with the proposed principle for allocation of places would be 43 per cent on grades, 42 per cent on locally determined selection criteria and 15 per cent on results of the SweSAT. Higher education institutions should still be able to allocate places in a different manner after having obtained permission from the Swedish Council for Higher Education and will continue to be permitted to decide to allocate places differently for programmes which lead to a qualification in the fine, applied and performing arts.</p>
<h2>Selection on the basis of grades</h2>
<p>One important point of departure for the provisions concerning selection on the basis of grades is that they are to be simple and comprehensible. The selection process must be able to handle all groups of applicants who have grades without needing various compensatory provisions. This increases the likelihood of the regulations being more sustainable over time.</p>
<p>In light of the above, the inquiry proposes that there be two groups within the grade-based selection process: one group containing applicants who have Swedish and foreign final school grades or equivalent and one group containing those who have assessments from folk high school, the proposed entrance examination or a validation process. Places are allocated between the two groups on the basis of the number of eligible applicants.</p>
<p>The current grade group for applicants who have grades that have been supplemented at a later stage in order to meet entry requirements or to raise their merit rating is removed. It is proposed that anyone who has supplemented their grades in order to meet the entry requirements instead compete in the grade group together with applicants who have grades straight from upper-secondary school or equivalent and applicants who have foreign grades. Certificates from access programmes at universities and university colleges and documented credits awarded from folk high schools will be given a merit rating equivalent to an E grade. The inquiry proposes that it not be permitted to use other forms of supplementation in the selection process.</p>
<p>The inquiry proposes that the system of credit increments be abolished as of admissions to the autumn semester of 2022. The inquiry does not believe that higher education admissions should be used to solve what should be solved at another educational level, in this case, inducing upper-secondary school pupils to study more advanced courses in mathematics and languages. If these courses are deemed entirely necessary in order for a student to benefit from a course or study programme, they should instead constitute specific entry requirements. This applies particularly to the higher level courses in mathematics and English. With regard to the subject of modern languages, the inquiry believes that there should be further investigation into what action may be needed in order to get more upper-secondary school pupils to study modern languages.</p>
<p>It is important that those who have had their competence validated for the general entry requirements also be able to receive a merit rating from such a validation process. For example, these may be people who have come to Sweden and who have insufficient or no documentation of their qualifications. The reason for proposing that these applicants and applicants with assessments from the entrance examination compete for places in the same group as applicants with student assessments from folk high schools is that these assessments will not be comparable with grades.</p>
<h2>Selection on the basis of the SweSAT</h2>
<p>The inquiry’s proposal involves the SweSAT remaining as a general instrument of selection, but with a somewhat more limited role than at present. It is an important to send a signal to upper-secondary school pupils that their studies in upper-secondary school are to be prioritised as long as they remain pupils there and that the SweSAT can be taken subsequently, as a second chance. At the same time, it is important that there are additional selection criteria, even for those coming straight from upper-secondary school, as these can function as a second chance.</p>
<p>The investigation proposes the introduction of a minimum age of 19 for taking the SweSAT. In practice, this means that the test may not be taken until the final semester of upper-secondary school. However, it needs to be possible to make exceptions to this age limit, for example for pupils gaining their upper-secondary qualification before the age of 19.</p>
<p>With the aim of improving the prognostic capability of the SweSAT, the inquiry proposes that it be possible to give different weighting to the results of the two parts of the test – the verbal and the quantitative – depending on the character and specialisation of the course or study programme. By applying this different weighting, higher education institutions can also make it clear to applicants what skills are of particular importance to the course or study programme they are applying for. This has an important value as a signal. It is also pertinent with regard to the SweSAT that higher education institutions have the ability to base their decisions on the prerequisites and needs of the specific course or study programme in a way that is better than that currently in use. The test is less effective as an instrument of selection for certain courses and study programmes, but it is assumed that applying a weighting improves its prognostic capability. It is proposed that the Swedish Council for Higher Education stipulate what types of weighting it is possible to apply.</p>
<p>The period of validity of SweSAT results is shortened from five to three years. It is currently possible for an individual to take the test an unlimited number of times. The inquiry proposes that a person be allowed to take the SweSAT an additional two times during the test’s validity period, which means that a person can take the test three times over a three-year period.</p>
<h2>Locally determined selection criteria</h2>
<p>The inquiry considers it important that there are locally determined selection criteria. Universities and university colleges will therefore be able to continue to choose to allocate a certain number of places based on the selection criteria that they themselves have determined. Locally determined selection criteria are currently used to a limited extent. The justifications given by those higher education institutions that use selection criteria are primarily that this makes it easier to adapt selection criteria to the needs and prerequisites of different courses and study programmes and that various instruments of selection can also be used with the aim of attracting applicants who have specific knowledge and experience.</p>
<p>A selection criterion determined by a higher education institution shall consist of a set of objective circumstances that are of significance to the course or study programme. It shall be possible for grades and results from the SweSAT to be used within the scope of this criterion, but in a manner that is different to that used in the grade and test-based selection process. An appraisal of different qualifications shall also be possible, for example of certain grades and results from an interview.</p>
<h2>Selection process for applicants with foreign qualifications</h2>
<p>The inquiry’s remit has included specifically analysing the need for selection criteria for applicants with foreign qualifications. The inquiry does not believe that any general selection criteria should be introduced specifically for this group of applicants. Nor should a general exemption be made from the Swedish language requirement imposed on individuals with a mother tongue other than Swedish. It is up to each individual higher education institution to make such decisions on the basis of the requirements of the specific course or study programme.</p>
<p>The inquiry is of the opinion that the proposals regarding the possibility of a merit rating being provided by the entrance exami- nation and a validation process could benefit this group of applicants, among others. An assessment from a validation process may mean that applicants, especially those who have insufficient or no docu- mentation, are able compete for places without simply being referred to the SweSAT. The inquiry also believes it to be important that people who are taking part in an establishment initiative and wish to continue on to higher education be prepared for this to the greatest possible extent during the establishment initiative.</p>
