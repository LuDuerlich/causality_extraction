<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In the ‘Defence policy direction bill’ (Govt Bill 2014/15:109 p. 24), the Government made the assessment that further deepening defence cooperation with Finland is particularly important and has become even more so in light of developments in our region. The Government stated that it sees many opportunities for far-reaching cooperation with Finland in all branches of the Swedish Armed Forces, and in other areas as well, such as secure communications between the two countries. The Government also made the assessment that defence cooperation between Finland and Sweden should be developed to include operational planning and preparations for the joint use of civilian and military resources in a variety of scenarios. It was stated that examples of this could include the assertion of each country’s territorial integrity or exercise of the right of self-defence in accordance with Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations. It was also stated that such planning should be a complement to, but separate from, each country’s national planning, and that the cooperation entails the possibility of joint action but no commitments. The Government declared that it intended to appoint an inquiry with the remit to review the legal conditions for such Swedish–Finnish cooperation.</p>
<p>The Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence endorsed the Government’s assessments on deepening defence policy cooperation with Finland and welcomed the Government’s intention to appoint an inquiry with the stated remit (Committee Report 2014/15:UFöU5). No reservations were expressed about these matters.</p>
<p>On 12 November 2015, the Government decided to task an Inquiry Chair with analysing the feasibility under the Instrument of Government for Sweden, provided that the necessary political decisions are taken, to act using military resources together with another state to meet an armed attack against either of the countries, and to prevent violations of either country’s territory in peace and during war between foreign states (ToR 2015:111). On 28 September 2016, this Feasibility Inquiry presented its report entitled ‘Feasibility of deepened defence cooperation under the Instrument of Government’ (SOU Series 2016:64).</p>
<p>On 23 March 2017, the Government set terms of reference for the Inquiry now in question: ‘The legal regulation of defence cooperation with Finland’ (ToR 2017:30).</p>
<h2>Remit</h2>
<p>The Inquiry was instructed to review certain elements of the legal conditions for Sweden’s defence cooperation with Finland, based on the analysis of the regulations in the Instrument of Government presented in the Feasibility Inquiry’s report (SOU Series 2016:64). The aim was to ensure that the necessary decisions on providing and receiving military support within the framework of Swedish– Finnish defence cooperation can be taken with sufficient speed, and that Finnish forces providing support to Sweden have the powers that are necessary in Sweden. The remit was primarily to consider and propose legal regulations authorising the Government, within Swedish–Finnish defence cooperation, to take certain decisions on providing and receiving military support, and to consider which powers Finnish forces providing military support to Sweden may need, and to propose any necessary legal regulation of these powers.</p>
<p>The Inquiry has understood its remit regarding the powers of Finnish forces in such a way that it includes not only the enforcement powers of Finnish forces, but other conditions as well that are necessary to enable Finnish military forces to provide active support.</p>
<p>The remit to consider and propose an authorising act has concerned decisions to provide military support to Finland to prevent violations of Finnish territory, decisions to request military support from Finland to meet an armed attack or in the event of a state of alert in Sweden, and decisions to request military support from Finland to prevent violations of Swedish territory.</p>
<h2>An Act on operational military support between Sweden and Finland</h2>
<p>The Feasibility Inquiry’s report established that at present any decisions to send Swedish armed forces abroad to support Finland in preventing any violations of Finnish territory require the Riksdag to first approve the sending of such forces in accordance with Chapter 15, Article 16 of the Instrument of Government. It was also established that any decisions to receive military support from Finland with the purpose of meeting an armed attack against Sweden or preventing violations of Swedish territory require the consent of the Riksdag in accordance with Chapter 10, Article 8 of the Instrument of Government, in the form of a decision to transfer administrative functions to another state. However, the Feasibility Inquiry’s report also states that there are legal conditions for the Riksdag in law to authorise the Government to take these decisions.</p>
<p>The current Inquiry considers that decisions on providing and receiving military support in the situations in question cannot be taken with sufficient speed within the framework of the Riksdag’s decision-making process, and that through authorisation in law the Government should be given greater powers to take decisions on its own, within the framework of deepened Swedish–Finnish defence cooperation, concerning providing and receiving operational military support. The Inquiry also considers that the Riksdag’s need to remain informed within the framework of these extended decisionmaking powers is ensured through the Government providing information to and conferring with the Advisory Council on Foreign Affairs pursuant to Chapter 10, Article 11 of the Instrument of Government.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that this authorisation of the Government should be regulated in an Act on operational military support between Sweden and Finland.</p>
<p>Under Section 1 of the proposed act, the Government may, at the request of Finland, deploy Swedish armed forces to support</p>
<p>Finland, in accordance with international law, to prevent violations of Finnish territory. The provision may be applicable when it is a question of providing military support in situations in which neither Sweden nor Finland are in armed conflict. For example, it could be a question of deploying Air Force units or naval units. A further requirement is that the support in question concerns measures to prevent violations of Finnish territory, and that the specific case in question concerns an armed force as set out in the Instrument of</p>
<p>Government. The expression ‘in accordance with international law’ clarifies that the support provided must always be compatible with the rules of international law, which corresponds to the terminology used in Chapter 15, Article 13 of the Instrument of Government.</p>
<p>It should be emphasised that it has not been part of the Inquiry’s remit to propose any changes regarding the Government’s decision-making procedure concerning the deployment of Swedish armed forces to support Finland to meet an armed attack. Such decisions will still need the consent of the Riksdag in specific cases in accordance with Chapter 15, Article 16 of the Instrument of Government.</p>
<p>Furthermore, under Section 2, the Government may also request support from Finland in the form of military forces</p>
<p>Accordingly, the provision applies to the deployment of Finnish military forces to Sweden to meet an armed attack or prevent territorial violations. These military forces may include military units, armed and staffed naval vessels, military aircraft or vehicles, or weapons systems with the appropriate personnel to handle them.</p>
<p>Similar to any support that is provided, any support that is requested must always be compatible with the rules of international law.</p>
<p>Any request from the Government for military support should contain information on the scope of the support, including length of time, geography, command and control, and the powers that the supporting forces are to have, etc. Certain preparations should have taken place at an earlier time to ensure that a government decision can be taken with sufficient speed. This will require operational planning and coordination at both political and military levels. It will also require administrative preparedness.</p>
<p>The information that should be contained in a government decision will depend on the form of joint action in question.</p>
<p>The aim of Section 2, as stated in the second paragraph of the provision, is that the Government is authorised to transfer to Finnish authorities any administrative functions in accordance with Chapter 10, Article 8 of the Instrument of Government. Administrative functions involving the exercise of public authority are also included pursuant to this Article. The functions to be transferred in any individual case are regulated more closely in the Government’s decision on that specific case. The powers that may be in question are stated in Section 3 of the act.</p>
<h2>Necessary powers for Finnish military forces that provide support</h2>
<p>Section 3 of the Act on operational military support between Sweden and Finland proposed by the Inquiry contains provisions authorising the Government to take decisions on powers for Finnish military forces that are providing support pursuant to the act.</p>
<p>The Inquiry considers that the powers listed in the act are necessary to enable Finnish military forces to provide appropriate support. Under the act, a Finnish military force may be given the following powers:</p>
<h2>Other necessary conditions for Finnish military forces that provide support</h2>
<p>The Inquiry has also presented proposals for other legal regulations that are necessary to enable Finnish military forces to provide appropriate support. These include introducing a new point in Section 5 of the Installations Protection Act (2010:305), stating that it is also possible to declare as protected objects areas in which Finnish military forces provide support under the Act on operational military support between Sweden and Finland. In light of this, we also propose certain consequential amendments to the Installations Protection Ordinance (2010:523).</p>
<p>Moreover, we propose introducing authorisations in the Aviation Act (2010:500) and the Aviation Ordinance (2010:770), which will enable the Government or the Swedish Armed Forces to take decisions on the Finnish military’s aviation activities in Sweden as conducted within the framework of the Act on operational military support between Sweden and Finland.</p>
<p>It is also proposed that exemptions are allowed from the permit requirement for the handling and transfer of explosive goods in the Flammable and Explosive Products Act (2010:1011) for Finnish military forces providing support under Section 2 of the Act on operational military support between Sweden and Finland.</p>
<p>Further, it is proposed that when Finnish military forces provide support under Section 2 of the proposed act, the Act on the transport of dangerous goods (2006:263) and the Ordinance on the transport of dangerous goods (2006:311) are not applied to the transport of goods under the Flammable and Explosive Products Act (2010:1011) when the transport is conducted by a Finnish military force, or to transport via Finnish aircraft, naval vessels and combat vehicles.</p>
<p>In addition, the Inquiry has proposed that Finnish military forces be exempt from the permit requirement for the use of radio transmitters under Chapter 3, Section 1 of the Electronic Communications Act (2003:389) and other conditions for the use of radio transmitters. They are only permitted to use radio transmitters within the radio frequencies assigned by the Swedish Armed Forces. The Swedish Armed Forces are permitted to make decisions on such use.</p>
<p>The Inquiry has also proposed an ordinance on the disclosure of classified information during operational military support between Sweden and Finland.</p>
<p>The Inquiry considers that there is no need for legal regulations concerning access to Swedish territory with regard to the Act on operational military support between Sweden and Finland. The reason for this is that the Government already has the possibility of issuing such a decision under the Ordinance concerning the Admission to Swedish Territory of Foreign State Vessels and State Aircraft (1992:118).</p>
<p>Moreover, the Inquiry considers that no additional legal regulation is needed concerning the import by Finnish military forces of firearms and ammunition to Sweden and the possession of these on Swedish territory. The reason for this is that the Government already has the possibility under the Firearms Act (1996:67) of issuing an exemption from the provisions of the act.</p>
<h2>Powers vis-à-vis foreign hostile forces</h2>
<p>The Inquiry’s remit did not include proposing any legal regulations of Swedish armed forces’ use of force in connection with the provision of support to Finland. The terms of reference, which refer to the conclusions of the Feasibility Inquiry in this regard, state that there is no reason to further investigate the need for a legal regulation of Swedish forces’ powers abroad.</p>
<p>However, the Inquiry has highlighted the Feasibility Inquiry’s conclusion that the Instrument of Government does not require the legal regulation of Swedish forces’ powers abroad vis-à-vis foreign hostile forces and that instead these powers follow from applicable international law, the agreement with the receiving state and the national mandate. The use of force and coercive measures must be supported by and carried out in accordance with applicable international law.</p>
<p>As the Feasibility Inquiry also established, nor is there need for any detailed legal regulation of the use of force by Finnish military forces vis-à-vis foreign hostile forces. This is a result of the fact that the regulation in the Instrument of Government on rights and freedoms (Chapter 2) and on laws and other regulations (Chapter 8) ultimately cannot be seen to cover such hostile forces as well. The use of force by Finnish forces in this regard is instead supported by the Government’s decision to request and receive military support and in other respects by international law.</p>
<p>The fact that the provision in the proposed act contains a reference to international law means there is clarification that the use of force must always be compatible with the rules of international law.</p>
