<p>Background to developments in the area of sanctions</p>
<p>Under the United Nations Charter, the UN Security Council has the power to decide on international sanctions in order to maintain or restore international peace and security. Under the provisions on a common foreign and security policy in the EU Treaty the European Union can decide on international sanctions, which it often does on account of decisions from the Security Council. UN and EU Member States are required under international law to implement such decisions in their countries. To the extent that UN and EU decisions come under community competence, which is the case with most economic sanctions, it is up to the European Community (EC) to implement sanctions and, in principle, Member States are prevented from implementing them separately. In these cases sanctions are implemented when the European Community adopts regulations that are directly applicable in Member States. National action to implement economic sanctions can only be considered if the EC is not able to implement a decision.</p>
<p>Until the early 1990s international sanctions were general and were only aimed at states in the form of trade and weapon embargoes, for example. Once it had been noted, especially in connection with sanctions against Iraq in 1990, that general sanctions often cause great suffering for the civilian population in a country without having any appreciable impact on the political leaders responsible, “smart sanctions” targeted on regimes and their representatives were developed instead. These targeted sanctions include asset freezes and travel restrictions. Because these sanctions hit the people who bear responsibility for a particular policy directly and spare the civilian population, targeted sanctions are held to be effective and humane.</p>
<p>In the late 1990s a series of terrorist acts was started that have been described as manifestations of a new type of terrorism. This</p>
<p>terrorism is not linked to the situation in a particular country or to a particular centre of conflict but is more about opposing western or American influence, mainly in the Middle East. The attacks have been linked to the exile Saudi Usama Bin Ladin and the Islamic alQaida terrorist network, which also claimed responsibility in several cases. The UN Security Council, which viewed the terrorist acts as a threat to international peace and security, decided in Resolution 1267 (1999) and the following resolution 1333 (2000) on targeted sanctions against the then-Taliban regime in Afghanistan and against Usama bin Ladin and al-Qaida, which had their base in Afghanistan and were supported by the Taliban regime. The sanctions also covered persons, groups and entities associated with above-mentioned parties.</p>
<p>The terror attacks culminated in the attacks in the United States on 11 September 2001, when around 3 000 people were killed. On 7 October 2001 the United States and its allies started an invasion of Afghanistan. A couple of months later the Taliban regime had fallen and lost control of the territory of Afghanistan. However, the sanctions introduced in the 1267 sanctions regime remained in place and were deepened, but they no longer had any link to a certain state, regime or area.</p>
<p>The Sanctions Act</p>
<p>The task of the Inquiry has been to review the Act (1996:95) on Certain International Sanctions – the Sanctions Act – mainly in order to adapt it to the new international regulatory framework in the area (Terms of reference: ToR 2005:34, see annex 1).</p>
<p>The Sanctions Act has two main functions. First, it contains an authorisation that enables the Government to implement UN and EU decisions on international sanctions against a “state under blockade” quickly and without the customary legislative procedure. Second, the Act also contains a provision that imposes criminal sanctions on breaches of a prohibition issued by Sweden under the Act or of a prohibition in EC Regulations on economic sanctions. Since Sweden entered the EU the Government has never used the delegated powers provisions of the Sanctions Act to implement sanctions. The sanctions that have been adopted by the Security Council and the EU have been implemented in Sweden by the EC or it has been possible to implement them under existing Swedish</p>
<p>legislation. The delegated powers provisions of the Sanctions Act should, however, remain in place in the event that the EC is unable in a particular instance to implement a sanctions decision of the Security Council or the EU.</p>
<p>Under the Sanctions Act sanctions can thus be implemented against a state under blockade, which is defined in the Act as “a state, an area or something else, such as an organisation or regime, that is subject to sanctions”. In view of the developments in the area described here, there is no longer any justification for building on the concept state under blockade. That concept should therefore be removed from the Act. The Inquiry proposes instead that the Government’s delegated powers under the Sanctions Act should be formulated so that the Government is empowered to issue regulations on a prohibition in relation to a state, an area, a natural or legal person, a group or an entity concerning the subjects that are already specified in Section 4 of the Act.</p>
<p>Certain obligations under international law</p>
<p>The Inquiry also has to analyse how Sweden fulfils its obligations under international law in the area of sanctions and to present proposals for the necessary legislation either as amendments to the Sanctions Act or, if this is deemed more appropriate, in a separate statute.</p>
<p>Both the 1267 sanctions regime and most other sanctions regimes contain sanctions committees that have the task of keeping and continuously updating lists of the individuals, groups, etc. who will be subject to the sanctions. The decision to put someone on such a list is binding on member states under international law. It the case of EU Member States it is the EC that has to implement the decisions. However, when a sanctions committee has issued such a decision, a number of days elapse from when the sanctions committee lists a person, group or entity until the EC acts. In part this is because the texts of resolutions and decisions must be translated into the official EU languages. When the sanctions refer to the freezing of assets, such a delay is an obvious problem. During the time that elapses from the publication of the new sanctions list in New York until there is an EC decision in Brussels the designated person is free to withdraw his funds from banks and financial institutions in the EU area.</p>
<p>One consequence of Sweden’s obligations under international law must be deemed to be that it must be possible to implement a freeze order without delay. In view of this, there is a need for Swedish legislation that allows assets in Sweden to be frozen provisionally in accordance with a decision by the Security Council or a sanctions committee under the Council to freeze assets. The Inquiry therefore proposes a new provision in the Sanctions Act under which Finansinspektionen (the Financial Supervisory Authority) shall implement without delay UN decisions concerning the freezing of economic assets or prohibitions on the provision of economic assets or financial services. The remit of Finansinspektionen will only relate to sanctions whose implementation can be expected within the framework of a pre-existing EC regulation on economic sanctions, i.e. in the event that the EC has already adopted rules on the implementation of sanctions in a certain sanctions regime and it is therefore clear that the EC is going to implement the sanctions decision. In addition, the orders made by Finansinspektionen will only apply to the financial institutions under its supervision and will not be directed at the general public. An order will only remain in force until the sanctions have been implemented by the EC and it must be combined with a penalty.</p>
<p>Security Council Resolution 1373 (2001) requires UN Member States to freeze all assets of persons who commit, participate in or facilitate the commission of terrorist acts. The same applies to assets held by a person who acts on behalf of or under the leadership of such persons or entities. The states shall also prohibit capital, economic assets or resources or financial services being made available to such persons or entities. Resolution 1373 targets terrorism and terrorists in general, irrespective of geographical origin. This means that no sanctions lists are drawn up under the 1373 sanctions regime. One measure taken by the EU in response to this Resolution has been to adopt a common position that contains provisions on the freezing of assets. A list of the names of individuals, groups and entities whose economic assets have to be frozen has been attached to the common position. This is the EU’s own sanctions list based on Security Council Resolution 1373. The common position also formed the basis for an EC Regulation in the matter. However, the implementation of sanctions by the EC only covers persons, groups and entities suspected of terrorist activities that have their roots, main activities and objectives in one or more third countries, i.e. EU-external terrorists. As regards persons, groups</p>
<p>and entities suspected of terrorist activities that have a corresponding link to an area inside the EU, i.e. EU-internal terrorists, Member States are therefore responsible for implementing sanctions under Resolution 1373.</p>
<p>The initial question is to what extent measures to freeze assets can be taken under existing Swedish legislation. It is possible, under the criminal procedure rules on seizure and attachment to secure assets under certain conditions when there is suspicion of an offence, including terrorist offences and their financing. However, Sweden’s obligations in the area under international law require more than can be achieved using these rules of criminal procedure. Seizure can only refer to particular property that is available for such a measure. Attachment only targets the property of the suspect and must normally refer to property of a specific value. Seizure and attachment do not prevent assets not covered by the seizure or attachment order from being placed at the disposal of the suspect. However, the freeze orders referred to in Resolution 1373 are intended to be comprehensive and to apply to all of the suspect’s property. It addition, others shall be prohibited from providing funds, financial assets, economic resources or financial services to the benefit of anyone who is suspected of a terrorist offence.</p>
<p>As further Swedish legislation is therefore required for the full implementation of Resolution 1373, the Inquiry proposes a separate act on the freezing of assets of suspected terrorists, etc. Under the proposal economic assets belonging to natural or legal persons, groups or entities shall be frozen if there are reasonable grounds to suspect them of having committed, planning to commit, attempting to commit, assisting in or promoting a terrorist offence. This means that the assets must not be paid out or disposed of in any other way. Such a decision shall also contain an order prohibiting the provision of economic assets and financial services, directly or indirectly, to any such natural or legal person, group or entity.</p>
<p>The order on the freezing of assets, etc. must be issued by a prosecutor. Penalties must be attached to the prosecutor’s order. The Act will be applicable to EU-internal and EU-external terrorists. However, in the case of the latter category, which falls under community competence, the prosecutor only has competence to order measures when an exemption clause in the EC Treaty is applicable. The Act will, of course, not apply to persons, groups and entities already covered by freezing measures under an EC Regulation on economic sanctions. It will be possible to issue a freezing</p>
<p>order under the proposed Act alongside a seizure or attachment order. In such a case a seizure or attachment order will have priority over a freezing order so that it can be implemented. The prosecutor’s order must be cancelled if there is no longer any reason for it, and it will also be appealable to the Stockholm City Court.</p>
<p>Certain issues concerning legal security</p>
<p>Under its terms of reference the Inquiry has also to consider what avenues, in addition to or instead of national measures, are available to achieve a comprehensive regulatory framework with clear guarantees of legal security in the UN and EU and to make the proposals deemed appropriate.</p>
<p>One clear and much discussed problem of the 1267 sanctions regime has been the lack of legal security in the proceedings. Serious and warranted criticism has been directed against the procedures in the sanctions committee that result in individuals being exposed to freezes and other far-reaching sanctions. The criticism has mainly been that the information in support of decisions is inadequate, that the procedure makes well-founded decisions impossible, that the person hit by the sanctions is refused all insight and does not have a right to take legal action against the decision and that there are no rules and no organisation for an effective review of the decisions. Even though certain changes have been made to the better, the Inquiry concludes that the 1267 sanctions regime does not currently meet minimum requirements of the rule of law.</p>
<p>The Swedish Government has criticised the present order but has assisted in the implementation of the sanctions, as the decisions of the Security Council, based on the provisions of the UN Charter, have precedence over other obligations of international law. The Inquiry presents a general description of the work that the Swedish Government has done up to now to improve the legal security of individuals in the event of targeted sanctions. This work should continue and be intensified. It goes without saying that dayto-day work must focus on the step-by-step improvement of the present system. Certain proposals concerning limited improvements of this kind are discussed in this report.</p>
<p>However, if such an approach making successive small improvements is to be sustainable and successful, it must be guided by an idea about the design of a system that does provide legal security.</p>
<p>Such an idea does not have to be developed from scratch, but can instead be derived clearly and distinctly from the conventions on human rights that Sweden has ratified, in common with many other countries, including all the permanent members of the Security Council. The Government is responsible for ensuring that the work of the Government Offices is guided by these principles and that they are maintained by those who represent our country in the Council of Ministers and the United Nations.</p>
<p>The most serious failing of the current system of targeted sanctions is that there is no right of review. This means that the UN is setting aside the minimum standard for the rule of law that is laid down in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the UN International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the European Convention for the protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. If the present arrangement with the listing of individuals remains in place, a system of court review of the listing decisions of the sanctions committees must be set up in accordance with the norms that the UN has established for its member states. Otherwise, the work of the United Nations to promote human rights and freedoms will lose credibility and be weakened.</p>
<p>A proposal to set up such a court can be expected to meet significant resistance, not least from leading members of the Security Council. Even if this resistance could eventually be overcome, which appears extremely uncertain, an operational court administration is probably a distant prospect on account of the legal and administrative problems and for reasons of cost. An alternative approach, which can be pursed in parallel with both the court line and reform work, is to encourage the Security Council to refrain from listing individuals who are not linked to regimes and to instead require states to develop their police cooperation and judicial cooperation under Resolution 1373. The Security Council is not contravening the UN Charter by taking far-reaching decisions about individuals through a sanctions committee, but this action is difficult to reconcile with the Council’s responsibility and enforcement powers under the Charter, with its organisation and with the fact that its decisions cannot be appealed.</p>
<p>The Constitutional Treaty</p>
<p>The final part of the remit of the Inquiry Chair has been to present proposals for legislation on the assumption that the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe (the Constitutional Treaty) will enter into force on 1 November 2006. The Treaty was signed by the heads of government of all Member States, and also by the heads of government of Turkey, Romania and Bulgaria, in Rome on 29 October 2004. Then a ratification process was begun, in which all Member States would approve the Treaty in accordance with their constitutional provisions. It was decided that the constitution could enter into force no earlier than 1 November 2006, or at a later time, if all Member States had not completed their ratification by that time.</p>
<p>In a referendum on 29 May 2005 the people of France voted no to the Constitutional Treaty. The citizens of the Netherlands also voted no in a referendum on 1 June of the same year. After the referendums in France and the Netherlands the ratification process came to a halt. The future of the Constitutional Treaty is therefore uncertain.</p>
<p>In light of the prevailing uncertainty concerning whether the Constitutional Treaty will enter into force in its present form the Inquiry refrains from presenting proposals for legislation based on the assumption that it will enter into force on 1 November 2006. However, the relevant provisions of the Treaty are described and analysed in the pertinent contexts in the body of the Inquiry’s report.</p>
