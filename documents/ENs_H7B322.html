<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>The Inquiry was instructed to conduct a review of Sweden’s environmental monitoring and propose both an appropriate delimitation in relation to related activities and changes to better meet future needs.</p>
<p>The overall aim of environmental monitoring is to monitor the state of the environment, identify new environmental risks and provide information to assess the progress made in achieving Sweden’s national environmental quality objectives.</p>
<p>Information from environmental monitoring is used by government agencies, local government and the business sector in community planning and granting permits for environmentally hazardous activities. An important component of environmental monitoring is Sweden’s reporting to the EU and other international bodies. In democratic societies, environmental monitoring also functions to provide information to citizens on the status of the environment. The interplay between environmental monitoring and environmental research is essential, not least for developing new monitoring methods and analysing new environmental threats.</p>
<p>The Inquiry has carried out a broad inventory of Sweden’s environmental monitoring. The Swedish Environmental Protection Agency has assisted the Inquiry with an inventory of environmental monitoring in the Nordic countries.</p>
<p>The Inquiry has proceeded on the assumption that environmental monitoring includes all activities that produce and gather environmental data on the state of and impact on the external environment, the presence of substances that may impact human health, and activities for handling, analysing and reporting on such environmental data. This definition is organisationally neutral and also takes into account corresponding activities performed by operators of environmentally hazardous activities. The environmental monitoring field is thus larger than what is carried out and financed by the central government. The definition aims to make it easier to manage and harness synergies, since environmental monitoring is conducted by many different actors.</p>
<p>Shortcomings that have emerged from the inventory include the fact that there is no overview of all environmental monitoring conducted, resulting in a lack of clarity regarding how resources are used. Environmental monitoring produces vast amounts of information that should be used to a greater extent to describe and analyse the state of the environment. The responsibility of several central government agencies is unclear. There is a lack of clarity regarding priorities in the overall management of environmental monitoring and within its various activities. This lack of clarity contributes to insufficient information for carrying out various analyses, including future assessments. This may lead to a failure to identify new environmental risks. There is also a lack of independent evaluations and reviews of monitoring activities in certain areas.</p>
<p>Total central government expenditure for environmental monitoring, including related activities, was estimated to be SEK 771 million in 2016. This amount includes a specific appropriation for environmental monitoring at the disposal of the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency and the Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management (SEK 313 million), and the financing of environmental monitoring conducted within other activities (SEK 458 million).</p>
<p>Several government agencies state that additional resources are required to meet the need for environmental monitoring within a number of areas, including water management and health-related environmental monitoring. Because there is no overview of which environmental monitoring is being conducted, it is not possible for the Inquiry to determine the extent to which additional resources are needed for state-financed environmental monitoring or the extent to which greater pooling of existing resources could meet these needs. The Inquiry therefore proposes organisational changes and a clarification of responsibility for central government agencies to ensure that coordination and resource utilisation can improve.</p>
<h2>The Inquiry’s proposals in brief</h2>
<p>1. A strategic plan for environmental monitoring should be decided by the Government and updated every fourth year. This plan will identify society’s need for environmental monitoring, coordination of government agencies, prioritised development initiatives, and future challenges.</p>
<p>2. An environmental monitoring council should be established at the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency. The council should have an independent chair, appointed by the Government, and members from relevant government agencies. The tasks of the environmental monitoring council should be to coordinate environmental monitoring, produce background material for the strategic plan, and report to the Government and the Riksdag.</p>
<p>3. The Government should specify environmental monitoring as a task in the ordinances containing instructions to government agencies that conduct environmental monitoring.</p>
<p>4. Responsibility for the national data hosts at government agencies should be specified in the ordinances containing instructions and financed via appropriation frames. These tasks are currently specified in agreements between the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency or the Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management and the data host concerned.  Data-host tasks of gathering and communicating environmental monitoring data should be reinforced. The pooling of data and its user-friendliness needs to improve.</p>
<p>5. County administrative boards’ regional environmental monitoring should be financed via appropriations and not, as today, via grants.</p>
