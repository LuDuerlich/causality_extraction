<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Inquiry remit</h2>
<p>The overall remit of the inquiry is to consider different ways of increasing the possibilities for involuntarily childless people to become parents. We are to submit an interim report containing proposals to offer single women the possibility of assisted fertilisation to correspond to the possibilities for married and cohabiting couples. In the interim report, we are also to propose necessary consequential amendments to regulations concerning parenthood and other legislation. The other parts of the remit, which include issues to do with surrogacy, are to be reported on no later than 24 June 2015.</p>
<h2>Scope</h2>
<p>In this interim report, we offer only proposals that give single women the possibility of insemination and in vitro  fertilisation (IVF) within the Swedish health care system, and proposals for necessary consequential amendments. We do not, therefore, offer proposals for changes in the regulations that apply when a child is conceived by a single woman following treatment abroad or by her own means. Furthermore, in principle we only deal with issues that are specific to single women. Issues that are of significance to both couples and single women, e.g. the question of whether assisted fertilisation using both donated eggs and donated sperm should be permitted, will not be tackled until the final report.</p>
<p>With respect to the interim report, the inquiry is not expected to propose new possibilities for two people to jointly become parents via assisted fertilisation. For this reason, no such proposals are made.</p>
<p>For people who have changed gender and retained their reproductive capacity, we consider that what has previously been stated – i.e. that the existing rules can be applied directly or analogically (see, for example, Government Bill 2012/13:107) – should apply until we take a position in the final report on the question of whether the current arrangements may cause problems in the application of various statutes. This means that all statements made concerning women in the interim report also apply to people who have changed gender from female to male (FTM) and retained their reproductive capacity.</p>
<h2>The inquiry’s starting points</h2>
<p>In our view, the principle of human dignity is crucial in issues concerning assisted fertilisation; it can never be a human right to bear one’s own child at any cost, and children conceived through assisted fertilisation must not be exposed to greater risks than other children. We also feel that the precautionary principle should be applied when giving new groups access to assisted fertilisation. Other principles are also crucial in issues to do with assisted fertilisation. These include the best interests of the child, equal care on equal terms, non-discrimination and the requirement of informed consent.</p>
<p>When taking positions on questions concerning assisted fertilisation, the various interests must always be weighed up, and the principle of the best interests of the child should be accorded particular importance. In such cases, society has a particular responsibility to oversee and safeguard the best interests of the prospective child.</p>
<p>The general rule should continue to be that a child has a right to two parents, and is guaranteed two legal parents, from birth. Regulations on assisted fertilisation for single women should therefore be seen as an exception to what otherwise applies.</p>
<h2>Amendments to the Genetic Integrity Act</h2>
<p>The key regulations concerning assisted fertilisation are found in the Genetic Integrity Act (2006:351). The regulations mean that married couples, registered partners and cohabiting partners can undergo insemination or in vitro  fertilisation within the Swedish health care system. As outlined above, our remit is to give single women a possibility to undergo assisted fertilisation corresponding to that available to married and cohabiting couples.</p>
<p>Firstly, we propose that a new term, ‘single woman’, be introduced into the Act and that the term be defined in Chapter 1, Section 5 of the Act. The definition includes any woman who is not married, a registered partner or a cohabiting partner. We also propose that the provisions concerning assisted fertilisation for single women be incorporated as a second paragraph in Chapter 6, Section 1 (insemination) and Chapter 7, Section 3 of the Act ( in vitro  fertilisation), and that the current second paragraph of Chapter 6, Section 1 become the third paragraph.</p>
<p>At present, there is a genetic link requirement associated with assisted fertilisation. This requirement means that treatment using both donated eggs and donated sperm is not permitted. The question of whether this requirement should be retained or not will be dealt with in our final report. The fact that the genetic link requirement will be retained for the time being necessitates an addendum in Chapter 7, Section 3, second paragraph of the Act. We therefore propose that a provision be inserted there to the effect that treatment of a single woman is only permitted using the woman’s own egg.</p>
<p>If a couple wish to undergo treatment using donated reproductive cells, the responsible doctor must assess whether it is appropriate for treatment to take place, taking account of the couple’s medical, psychological and social circumstances. Treatment may only take place if it can be assumed that the prospective child will grow up in favourable conditions (Chapter 6, Section 3 and Chapter 7, Section 5 of the Act). We have considered whether the introduction of the possibility of assisted fertilisation for single women requires any changes in substance to these regulations, and have concluded that it does not. We therefore propose that the provisions only be amended such that they will also be applicable to the treatment of single women.</p>
<p>A couple who are refused treatment have the possibility to request a review of their case by the National Board of Health and Welfare. Naturally, such a possibility of a review should also be available to a single woman who is refused treatment. This requires amendments to Chapter 6, Section 3, second paragraph and Chapter 7, Section 5, second paragraph of the Act.</p>
<p>In the case of in vitro  fertilisation, Chapter 7, Section 2 of the Act states that a donor of eggs or sperm must be of age, must give consent in writing to the egg being fertilised or to the sperm being used for fertilisation, and may retract their consent up to the point of fertilisation. What is stated in the section of law concerning sperm donors should also apply, where relevant, to insemination. We therefore propose that a new section of law, Chapter 6, Section 1a, be introduced into the Act prescribing that a sperm donor must be of age, that the donor must give consent in writing to his sperm being used for insemination, and that a sperm donor may retract his consent up to the point of insemination.</p>
<p>Under the Genetic Integrity Act, there is no possibility for a sperm donor to limit his consent such that his sperm may only be used for the treatment of, for example, different-sex couples. Nor is there any provision to the effect that treatment of same-sex couples requires special consent to be obtained from the sperm donor. The introduction of the possibility of assisted fertilisation for single women does not require any amendment to the rules that currently apply. This means that no regulation should be introduced whereby a sperm donor can exclude single women as recipients of his sperm. We will address what rules should apply to sperm donated prior to the entry into force of the new regulations in the section ‘Entry into force and transitional provisions’.</p>
<p>In all other respects, the rules that currently apply to couples should also apply to single women. This means, among other things, that it should be possible to treat single women at those medical facilities that are currently permitted to carry out equivalent treatment on couples.</p>
<h2>Consequential amendments to the Children and Parents Code</h2>
<p>We have considered what amendments are necessary to the Children and Parents Code in light of the amendments to the Genetic Integrity Act, and have concluded that the need for amendments is limited.</p>
<p>The basic premise should be that the child in these cases will only have one legal parent, the mother. In light of this premise, we have considered whether there is a need to introduce exceptions in the Children and Parents Code to the rules that currently apply in some respects, i.e. special rules that are only applicable in cases where a child is conceived through treatment of a single woman. Our conclusion is that there is no need for this. We believe that there is no need to introduce an exception to the presumption of paternity whereby a woman’s husband is automatically considered the child’s father regardless of whether or not he is the child’s biological father. In exceptional cases where a woman marries a man between an assisted fertilisation as a single woman and the birth of the child, the presumption can – in the same way as in other cases where it produces an ‘incorrect’ result – be annulled pursuant to Chapter 1, Section 2 of the Children and Parents Code. Nor should any prohibition be introduced on confirming that the sperm donor is the father in cases where a woman has undergone treatment when single. In other words, it should be possible to establish that a man whose sperm has been used in treatment of a single woman is the father via a confirmation process, provided that the man and woman, or the child, if of age, agree to this (see Chapter 1, Section 4 of the Children and Parents Code).</p>
<p>The question then remains what rules should apply in the majority of cases, where a woman has undergone assisted fertilisation while single and, for example, there is no husband to be considered the father of the child. In such cases, the basic premise should be that there is no need to establish paternity or parenthood. We therefore propose that a new section of law, Chapter 1, Section 3a, be introduced into the Children and Parents Code, stating that there is no need to establish paternity or parenthood if the mother has undergone insemination or in vitro  fertilisation in accordance with the Genetic Integrity Act, she was single at the time of treatment in accordance with Chapter 1, Section 5 of that Act, and it is likely, in view of all of the circumstances, that the child was conceived via that treatment. The use of the term ‘no need to’ means that even if the conditions in the section are fulfilled, a possibility remains open to establish the sperm donor as the father of the child via a confirmation process (see above).</p>
<p>The fact that the majority of cases will not require paternity or parenthood to be established necessitates certain amendments to Chapter 2 of the Children and Parents Code. We propose that a new second paragraph be introduced into Chapter 2, Section 7 of the Code, stating that the Social Welfare Committee must  discontinue any investigation of paternity or parenthood that has already begun if the conditions in Chapter 1, Section 3a are fulfilled. The current second paragraph of this section would then become the third paragraph. An amendment should be made to Chapter 2, Section 9 of the Code, to the effect that what is stated in Chapter 2, Section 7 also applies to investigations initiated under Chapter 2, Section 9. In all other respects, what is stated in Chapter 2 of the Children and Parents Code should also apply to investigations in these cases, as far as is relevant.</p>
<h2>Entry into force and transitional provisions</h2>
<p>The legislative amendments should come into force on 1 July 2015. In order to satisfy the requirement of informed consent within the health care system, we propose that a transitional provision be introduced into the Genetic Integrity Act. Under this provision, sperm donated prior to the entry into force of the new regulations may not be used in assisted fertilisation of single women without express consent in writing from the donor.</p>
<h2>Consequences of our proposals</h2>
<p>The proposals will lead to increased demand within the health care system for assisted fertilisation using donated sperm. If this demand were met in full, the estimated cost increase for the health care system as a whole would be SEK 60–80 million. As was the case with previous legislative amendments in this area, it will be up to each county council to decide how available resources are to be allocated, and whether assisted fertilisation can be offered within existing activities or whether patients should be charged a fee for this type of treatment.</p>
<p>In all other respects, it is estimated that the consequences of these proposals will be small or marginal. It is estimated that any cost increases should be manageable using existing resources or within existing frameworks.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, we would like to emphasise the importance of further research in this area, and in particular research concerning the conditions in Sweden and the consequences for the children.</p>
