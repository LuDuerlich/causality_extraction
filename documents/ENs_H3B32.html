<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In May 2014 the European Parliament and the Council adopted a Directive (MiFID II) and a Regulation (MiFIR) on markets in financial instruments, see Annexes 4 and 5. These legal instruments replace the MiFID of 2004.</p>
<p>MiFID II and MiFIR contain a number of rules, mainly for investment firms and regulated markets. The new legal instruments entail partly the transfer of a large proportion of the rules in the 2004 Directive more or less unchanged to the MiFID II, and partly the introduction of new rules or more detailed rules than those of the 2004 Directive. Some of the rules in the 2004 Directive – for example on transparency – are now found in MiFIR. This Regulation also contains entirely new rules.</p>
<p>The main remit of the Inquiry has been to analyse what changes are required in current Swedish regulations in order to implement the new legal instruments. Moreover, the remit included reviewing some issues concerning financial advisory services that are not currently subject to licensing and commercial law regulation, considering whether these advisory services should also be subject to licensing and commercial law regulation and if so draw up the necessary legislative proposals.</p>
<p>After an introduction, in which the conditions for the Inquiry and its work are described (Chapter 2), the report describes the background to the new legal instruments, which are presented briefly (Chapter 3). There then follows a chapter with some general principles (Chapter 4). The report proposals are presented in Chapters 5– 14. The Inquiry’s main proposals from the different chapters are presented below.</p>
<h2>Scope etc. (Chapter 5)</h2>
<p>MiFID II and MiFIR, in common with the 2004 Directive, are applicable to certain services and activities referring to financial instruments. Thus when services and activities concern financial instruments they are subject to licensing and must be conducted in accordance with the MiFID II and MiFIR rules. The definition of the term financial instrument in the MiFID II is by and large the same as in the 2004 Directive. One new feature is that emission allowances are financial instruments under MiFID II and the Inquiry proposes that Swedish rules be changed so that this is stated in the Securities Market Act (2007:528). The investment services and activities that are subject to licensing requirements are also mainly the same in MiFID II and the 2004 Directive. However, the Inquiry proposes some adjustments in the designation and definition of the services and activities in the legislative text to achieve implementation that is closer to the Directive. One new feature in substance is operation of an organised trading facility (OTF), which is a new type of trading venue for financial instruments. The Inquiry proposes that this activity be included as a new investment activity subject to licensing in the Securities Market Act.</p>
<p>Several of the provisions in MiFID II, including most of the investor protection rules, are also applicable when an investment firm sells or provides advisory services on structured deposits , which are not financial instruments as such. The Inquiry proposes that this extension of scope also be introduced in Swedish law.</p>
<p>Under MiFID II a number of firms, occurrences and activities are outside its scope. By and large the exemptions are the same as in the 2004 Directive with some minor differences, for example as regards some activities referring to commodity derivatives and emission allowances. It is also clear from MiFID II that central securities depositories – called “centrala värdepappersförvarare” in Swedish law – will be exempted. The Inquiry proposes that the exemptions under Swedish law be adapted to the changes mentioned.</p>
<h2>Infrastructure of the securities market (Chapter 6)</h2>
<p>Many of the provisions of MiFID II and MiFIR concern the infrastructure of the securities market, i.e. the different types of trading venues (regulated market, MTF and OTF) that exist, how they should be organised and how trading should be conducted there and outside the market places. Also included in this area are issues concerning transparency (i.e. publication of orders and transactions), requirements of investment firms that conduct algorithmic trading, transaction reporting and position limitats when trading in commodity derivatives and emission allowances. The new data reporting services also constitute part of the infrastructure of the securities market.</p>
<p>As mentioned, the Inquiry proposes that operation of an OTF be included as a new investment activity subject to licensing in the Act. In addition, the Inquiry proposes some adjustments to the Swedish definitions of regulated market and MTF to achieve regulation that is more in line with the Directive.</p>
<p>MiFID II contains a number of detailed rules for trading in regulated markets. The Inquiry proposes that the new requirements in MiFID II for synchronisation of clocks, trading systems with sufficient capacity and resilience, written agreements on market making activities, transparent and non-discriminatory fee structures and rules on co-location and tick sizes be included in the Securities Market Act. The Inquiry also proposes that the rules on suspension and removal of a financial instrument from trading be adapted to the requirements of MiFID II. This means that an explicit rule will be included in the Act concerning suspension and removal decided by an operator of a trading venue and how this is to be communicated to Finansinspektionen (the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority). Most of the rules for regulated markets should also apply to MTF´s and OTF´s. The Inquiry also proposes that an MTF could be registered as an SME (small and medium-sized enterprises) growth market. Small and medium-sized enterprises are companies with an average market value of less than EUR 200 million. Such registration means some relaxation in the requirements for admission to trading and to information about issuers.</p>
<p>Several of the provisions in the directly effective Regulation (MiFIR) have no equivalent in Swedish law. This applies for example to the requirements to trade derivatives in a marketplace, some rules concerning central counterparties for clearing, rules on benchmarks and the obligation of investment firms to trade shares on a trading venue. These rules will not entail any legislative amendments.</p>
<p>The rules concerning transparency, i.e. the requirements to publish orders and transactions for financial instruments are found in MiFIR. The same applies to the rules on documentation of orders and transactions and reporting transactions to the competent authority. The rules on systematic internalisers, i.e. investment firms which systematically deal on their own account when executing client orders outside a regulated market, are now found in MiFIR. In view of this, the Inquiry proposes that the current provisions on transparency, documentation of orders and transactions, transaction reporting and on systematic internalisers be removed from the Securities Market Act.</p>
<p>In MiFID II there are, in relation to the 2004 Directive, new rules concerning limits for position management and reporting positions in commodity derivatives and emission allowances etc. The Inquiry proposes that the Securities Market Act prescribe that Finansinspektionen must establish quantitative thresholds for the positions in commodity derivatives an individual person or an individual firm can hold. Operators of trading venues must monitor the positions in commodity derivatives that individuals or firms hold and must be able to force a termination or reduction of a position and also be able to force the holder of a large or dominant position to provide liquidity back to the market. Moreover, operators of trading venues which trade commodity derivatives, emission allowances or derivatives thereof, must publish a weekly report with the aggregate positions in the relevant financial instruments. The market operator must also provide on a daily basis more detailed information showing a breakdown of positions per holder to Finansinspektionen.</p>
<p>As a result of MiFID II a number of data reporting services are subject to licensing. This is a matter of providing an “approved publication arrangement” (APA), of being a “consolidated tape provider” (CTP) and providing an “approved reporting mechanism” (ARM). An approved publication arrangement (APA) means that someone publishes transactions on behalf of an investment firm in accordance with the transparency rules of MIFIR. A consolidated tape provider (CTP) provides a consolidated view of transactions from several different trading venues and participants, which facilitates for market participants to gain access to relevant information. Finally, an approved reporting mechanism (ARM) reports transactions to the competent authorities or the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) on behalf of an investment firm. This mainly refers to transaction reporting under MiFIR. The licensing conditions and the requirements of licensed firms are similar to the conditions and requirements applicable to investment firms. The Inquiry proposes that this be provided for in a separate chapter of the Securities Market Act.</p>
<p>MiFID II includes a number of rules concerning algorithmic trading and algorithmic high frequency trading. The rules aim to deal with the risks and problems associated with this type of activity. The provisions of MiFID II are directed at both investment firms’ own trading and at their trading on behalf of clients. The rules are “new” in the sense that previously there were no binding rules in the area in any directive or regulation. The Inquiry proposes that an investment firm that conducts algorithmic trading on its own behalf must, in accordance with the provisions of MiFID II, have effective systems and risk controls to ensure that the firm’s trading systems are resilient and have sufficient capacity. The system must have the necessary thresholds, limits and filters to prevent incorrect orders and to prevent the system functioning in a way that disrupts the market. The firm must also have effective systems and controls to ensure that the algorithmic trading is not used for market abuse or to violate trading rules in the trading venue where the trading takes place. The firm in question must have continuity arrangements that can deal with any failure of its trading systems. In addition, firms must notify the competent authority and the trading venue where the trading takes place of their arrangements in these respects. The competent authority may require an investment firm – on a regular or ad hoc basis – to provide a description of the nature of its algorithmic trading strategies, details of the trading parameters or limits to which the system is subject and the controls that the firm has in place to ensure compliance with the rules. Even if an investment firm does not itself engage in algorithmic trading, it may have clients that do so, for example in that they use “direct electronic access”. For this reason MiFID II includes provisions on controls and responsibilities for investment firms that provide direct electronic access. The Inquiry proposes that provisions be included in the Securities Market Act stipulating that these firms must have effective systems and controls in place to ensure proper assessment of the suitability of clients to whom the service is provided. There must be trading and credit thresholds that clients may not exceed, and trading must be monitored so that the firm can prevent trading that could create risks to the investment firm itself or that could create a disorderly market or could be contrary to the Market Abuse Regulation (Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council [EU] 596/2014). The firm must also ensure that there is a written agreement that specifies the rights and obligations of the client and the investment firm.  Firms that provide direct electronic access must also inform their competent authority as well as the relevant trading venue of this . The competent authority may require the investment firm to provide, on a regular or ad hoc basis, a description of the systems and controls that the firm has in place regarding direct electronic access.</p>
<h2>A consistent regulation of financial and investment advice (Chapter 7)</h2>
<p>MiFID II contains a number of rules aimed at protecting investors. The rules in the Directive are, however, solely directed at investment firms and are dealt with in Chapters 8 and 9. Chapter 7 deals with the national issue of whether it is possible to achieve consistent regulation for all providers of advisory services to consumers on investment, regardless of corporate form. The main regulation of this type of advice is in the Financial Advisory Services to Consumers Act (2003:362) (Advisory Services Act) and in the Securities Market Act. But activities that in themselves may entail elements of advisory services are regulated in the Insurance Mediation Act (2005:405), the Insurance Business Act (2010:2043), the Investment Funds Act (2004:46) and the Act on Alternative Investment Fund Managers (2013:561). The rules are very similar and have the same consumer protection purpose. The Inquiry proposes that the rules be completely aligned so that they are not only similar but exactly the same. Consequently, the Inquiry proposes that a provision be introduced into the legislation for each corporate form that the rules on advisory services in the Securities Market Act be applicable when the firm in question provides advisory services to consumers.</p>
<h2>Rules on benefits to or from third parties (Chapter 8)</h2>
<p>MiFID II contains a minimum rule on benefits from third parties to independent advisors and portfolio managers. If the investment firm has informed the client that the advice is independent, the firm may not accept and retain benefits from any third party, and in its advice the firm must assess several different product providers’ and issuers’ products as well as those of its own or of firms with close links to the investment firm. Nor may a portfolio manager, under the minimum rule, accept and retain benefits from third parties. If an independent advisor or portfolio manager accepts a benefit from a third party the advisor/manager must forward this benefit to the client. This rule must be introduced into Swedish law, which is also what the Inquiry proposes. However, in the opinion of the Inquiry, the minimum rule alone would not rectify the commission problems. Supervision by Finansinspektionen has shown that benefits from third parties lead to conflicts of interest and advisors putting their own interests in obtaining large commissions before the clients’ interests. The minimum rule would not lead to sufficient reinforcement of consumer protection. The Inquiry proposes therefore that Sweden takes the opportunity to go further than the minimum rule and extend the prohibition against accepting benefits from third parties to cover all advisory services, independent or not, to non-professional clients. The same should apply to portfolio management provided to non-professional clients. The Inquiry proposes that the prohibition be designed so that benefits from a third party that may have a negative effect on clients’ interests be forbidden and that Finansinspektionen be given the right to prescribe in detail the benefits in question. This kind of commission prohibition may be designed to apply to commission that entails a negative impact on clients’ interests, without applying to commission that does not. As previously mentioned, the Inquiry proposes that the same rules should apply to all advisors, regardless of corporate form. This means in the area of commission that the prohibition on accepting and retaining benefits from third parties that may have a negative impact on clients’ interests will also apply to insurance companies and insurance intermediaries when they provide financial advice to consumers in the course of their ordinary business.</p>
<p>The Inquiry also proposes that Sweden goes further than required by the Directive as regards the requirements to be met in order to be called an independent advisor. Under the minimum rule an independent advisor may give advice on its own products as long as the advisor’s range of products includes a sufficient number of external products. The Inquiry proposes that the requirement be tightened so that only those advising on external products may call themselves independent advisors. These provisions will also apply to insurance companies and insurance intermediaries.</p>
<p>Apart from the rules specifically applicable to investment advice and portfolio management, MiFID II also includes general provisions on benefits from third parties that apply to all investment services. The rules mean that an investment firm, when rendering services to clients, may not accept benefits from anyone other than the client, unless the client has been informed of the benefit and the benefit is designed to enhance the quality of the service concerned and does not prevent the firm from complying with its duty to act in the best interest of its clients. This rule already exists in Finansinspektionen’s Regulations. The Inquiry proposes that the rule be incorporated into the Securities Market Act.</p>
<h2>Other investor protection and conduct of business rules (Chapter 9)</h2>
<p>Apart from the rules concerning benefits from third parties MiFID II contains a number of stricter requirements and new regulations in the area of client protection. These apply to the rules on competence requirements, assessment of suitability, information on appropriateness of advice, packaged products, conflicts of interest and rules on developing and distributing products. These rules, together with new rules on recording and other documentation of orders are dealt with in Chapter 9.</p>
<p>Under MiFID II investment firms must ensure that the natural persons that provide investment advice as well as the natural persons that provide information on financial instruments, investment services or ancillary services have the knowledge and competence required to fulfil their obligations. The criteria used to assess knowledge and competence are to be published. The Inquiry proposes that a provision on this be incorporated into the Securities Market Act and that Finansinspektionen be entitled to issue more detailed regulations on competence requirements.</p>
<p>The rules concerning assessment of suitability for investment advice and portfolio management in MiFID II are by and large the same as in the 2004 Directive. The rules stipulate that firms must obtain information about clients’ knowledge and experience in the investment field, about the client’s financial situation and about the client’s investment objectives, so as to be able to use the information obtained to give suitable advice or propose a suitable management strategy. In MiFID II the rules have been developed somewhat to specify that the information about the client’s financial situation must include the client’s ability to bear losses and the information on the client’s investment objectives must include the client’s risk tolerance, and suitability is to be assessed, particularly in relation to this and the client’s ability to bear losses. In addition there is a new provision that firms recommending a package of bundled services or products – for example an investment together with a loan – must consider in their assessment whether the overall bundled package is suitable. Another new feature compared with the 2004 Directive is that an investment firm must inform the client whether the firm will provide periodic assessment of the suitability of the financial instruments recommended to them. Another new provision in relation to the 2004 Directive is that an investment firm providing investment advice must inform the client why the advice given by the firm is suitable. The information must be provided in written form before the transaction proposed by the firm takes place, and it must state how the advice meets the needs, preferences and other characteristics of the client. The Inquiry proposes that the provisions in the Securities Market Act be amended to include the new requirements.</p>
<p>In the area of conflict of interest the Inquiry proposes that the current rules on conflict of interest, in line with the system of the Directive, be broken down into one rule imposing requirements on the organisation of firms and another imposing requirements on identification, prevention and handling of conflicts of interest, as well as in some cases providing information to clients. This breakdown facilitates interpretation and application of the rules. The Inquiry also proposes that firms provide information to clients concerning conflicts of interest in a durable medium, and the information should be sufficiently detailed to enable the client to make an informed decision with respect to the investment service or ancillary service in the context of which the conflict of interest arises. The Inquiry also proposes that the Securities Market Act be supplemented with a provision that investment firms may not remunerate or assess the performance of their staff in a way that conflicts with the firm’s obligation to safeguard clients’ interests. The firms must in particular avoid remuneration systems that may lead to staff recommending a particular financial instrument to a non-professional client when the firm should have proposed another instrument which would better meet that client’s needs.</p>
<p>MiFID II regulates the situation where an investment firm provides a package solution consisting of an investment service together with another service or product, or where the provision of a service or product is a condition for another service or product. One example of this kind of “package” is a securities institute providing a custody service (safe-keeping of financial instruments) together with custodial credit (lending). The Inquiry proposes that a provision be included in the Securities Market Act stipulating that investment firms that provide a package solution consisting of an investment service bundled with another service or product, or that stipulate that provision of a service or product is a condition for another product or service, must inform the client whether it is possible to buy the different components of the package separately and of the cost of each separate component. In the event that the package in itself entails a heightened risk compared with provision of the different components separately, the firm must inform the client how the different components affect the risk level.</p>
<p>MiFID II stipulates that investment firms must have a process for the approval of financial instruments developed for sale to the firm’s clients. The process is to be designed so that the firm identifies a target market of end clients for which the financial instrument in question is adapted. This may consist for example of consumers with certain experience or a certain risk profile. On the basis of the intended target market, the investment firm must assess whether the instrument in question is typically suitable, for example as regards the risks associated with an investment. The assessment must also include the changes that may occur, for example value changes due to market events. When the instrument has been through the approval process and constitutes a part of the investment firm’s offer, the firm must periodically review the instrument – taking into account any events that could materially affect the target market – to assess whether the target market and distribution are still suitable. There are similar rules for investment firms that do not themselves produce investment products but distribute those of others, stipulating that the firm should have arrangements in place to obtain information concerning the product approval process, and be able to understand the characteristics of the instrument in question and the intended target market. The firm should also ensure that the instruments are distributed to the intended target market and only offered to clients when it is in the clients’ interest. The Inquiry proposes that provisions be included in the</p>
<p>Securities Market Act on the product approval process that correspond to the provisions of the Directive.</p>
<p>MiFID II contains provisions stipulating that investment firms must record telephone conversations intended to result in transactions in financial instruments when dealing on own account or on behalf of clients. Electronic communication for the same purpose must be retained. The records must be kept for five years – or longer where requested by the competent authority, though no more than seven years – and be provided to the client involved on request. Clients’ orders received otherwise than via telephone or electronic communication must be documented in a durable medium. The Inquiry proposes that provisions be included in the Securities Market Act on recording etc. that correspond to the provisions of the Directive.</p>
<h2>Cross-border activities (Chapter 10)</h2>
<p>The rules governing cross-border activities in MiFID II are, for European firms, by and large the same as in the 2004 Directive. The changes in this area consist of the rules on branches also being applicable when an investment firm uses a tied agent in another Member State. New in MiFID II are rules on firms from countries outside the EEA that establish branches within the EEA. The Inquiry proposes in this area that Sweden utilise the opportunity offered by MiFID II to impose a requirement that firms outside the EEA must establish a branch in order to provide investment services in Sweden.</p>
<h2>Corporate governance etc. (Chapter 11)</h2>
<p>MiFID II supplements the generally formulated requirements that boards of directors and managing directors of investment firms and market operators must be of sufficiently good repute, possess sufficient knowledge, skills and experience, with provisions that the board of directors and managing director must collectively have sufficient knowledge, skills and experience to understand the firm’s activities in general and risks of the business in particular. All of the board members as well as the managing director must act with honesty, integrity and independence of mind to be able to effecttively assess and challenge the decisions of senior management and to monitor decision-making. The Directive also contains a restriction on the number of directorships a person may hold at the same time. Applicable to all firms is that a general reasonability assessment must be made of the number of directorships an individual board member should have. The assessment is dependent on the nature, scale and complexity of the business. For firms of considerable size there is also an explicit quantitative restriction. The Inquiry assesses that the requirements of the Directive concerning the board and its members and the managing director of investment firms are already implemented through the provisions implementing corresponding requirements under the Capital Requirements Directive . The Inquiry proposes that the corresponding provisions for market operators – concerning the collective knowledge and experience of the board, restriction on the number of directorships members of management may hold and the requirement to commit sufficient time to be able to perform their functions – shall be included in the Securities Market Act. The more specific requirements in MiFID II concerning the board and its members as well as the managing director in a market operator are to be implemented through agency regulations.</p>
<p>MiFID II imposes requirements on corporate governance by the management body. In Swedish law the management body refers to the board of directors or the board of directors and  the managing director. The requirements are generally worded. The management body must design and implement (or monitor implementation of) governance arrangements that ensure effective and prudent management of the organisation, including the segregation of duties in the firm and prevention of conflicts of interest. This is specified in more detail for investment firms. The management body must define, approve and oversee the organisation of the firm as regards the provision of investment services. When designing the organisation, the nature, scale and complexity of the business must be taken into account. The management body must also define, approve and oversee a policy as to the services, activities, products and operations offered or provided by the firm. This is to be in accordance with the risk tolerance of the firm and taking into account the characteristics and needs of the clients. The management body must also draw up a remuneration policy aiming to encourage fair treatment of clients and avoid conflicts of interest. Finally, the management body must monitor and periodically assess the firm’s governance arrangements and policies for provision of services and take appropriate steps to address any deficiencies. The management body must also have access to all information needed to oversee and monitor management decision-making. The Inquiry proposes that a catalogue of the board of directors and managing director’s tasks be included in the Securities Market Act.</p>
<h2>Supervision (Chapter 12)</h2>
<p>Implementation of MiFID II entails some expansion of Finansinspektionen’s supervisory tools. In this respect the Inquiry proposes that Finansinspektionen’s supervisory toolbox be supplemented by the ability to apply for attachment to secure a claim relating to a financial penalty, the right to prohibit actions that may be assumed to violate the law or MiFIR (including the right to prohibit some professional activities), the right to require a person to take action to reduce the size of a position or exposure, the right to restrict a person’s ability to enter into a commodity derivative, and the right to stop marketing or sale of financial instruments or structured deposits if an investment firm has failed to develop or apply an effective process for product development, or if the firm has otherwise failed to comply with the product development process.</p>
<p>MiFID II regulates cooperation between competent authorities in different Member States and cooperation between European supervisory authorities. In the opinion of the Inquiry, after some minor amendments the current Swedish rules fulfil the requirements of the Directive concerning collaboration and exchange of information between the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) and the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA).</p>
<p>One new feature in MiFID II is the provisions on mechanisms and protection for whistle-blowers. The Directive imposes requirements partly for effective mechanisms for reporting and protection of persons reporting infringements to the competent authority and partly for firms subject to licensing to have in place appropriate procedures for internal reporting. An employee who reports serious infringements must be protected against retaliation, discrimination or other types of unfair treatment. In addition, the identity of both the person who reports the infringements and the person allegedly responsible (if it is a natural person) must as a general rule be protected. The purpose of special reporting systems, called whistleblower systems, is to make it possible primarily for all staff to report serious events without fear of reprisals. The Inquiry proposes that the obligation of competent authorities to set up effecttive procedures to receive and follow up reports of infringements be implemented through regulations at ordinance level. As regards protection of identity, in the assessment of the Inquiry this has been taken care of by Chapter 30, Section 4 b of the Public Access to Information and Secrecy Act (2009:400) that was recently introduced to implement the corresponding provision of the Capital Requirements Directive. However, the Inquiry proposes that the Public Access to Information and Secrecy Act be supplemented by a provision stipulating that anonymity will also apply to a natural person that is identified in a report as responsible for an infringement. The Inquiry also proposes that the existing provision in the Securities Market Act stipulating that investment firms must have appropriate systems for dealing with reports on alleged irregularities within the firms, is also to apply to market operators and suppliers of data reporting services.</p>
<h2>Interventions (Chapter 13)</h2>
<p>The provisions on administrative sanctions and measures in MiFID II differ substantially from the corresponding provisions of the 2004 Directive, which were designed to direct Member States to ensure that there were effective sanctions in place against infringements of the provisions of the Directive. The more detailed wording of the sanctions was then left to each Member State. The provisions of</p>
<p>MiFID II are considerably more detailed. They specify the infringements that may give rise to sanctions; that natural persons in firms’ management bodies may be subject sanctions; the various types of sanctions that should exist and the size of fines. To implement these provisions the Inquiry proposes that for Swedish investment firms, market operators and Swedish suppliers of data reporting services it be specified which provisions of the Act and MiFIR that may entail intervention for an infringement. If a Swedish investment firm, a market operator or a Swedish supplier of data reporting services has infringed a provision of the Securities Market Act or of MiFIR, it must be possible to impose sanctions on the firm. In such cases it shall also be possible to impose a sanction on a member of the board or a managing director of the firm or market operator, or their substitute, if the person in question intentionally or through gross negligence has acted to cause the infringement. This only applies, however, if the firm’s infringement is of a serious nature. A provision is also to be introduced into the Act to the effect that no intervention is to be made if the infringement at the same time constitutes a prosecutable act.</p>
<p>The sanctions that may be relevant to firms are the same as under current law, for example withdrawal of licences and financial penalties. The sanctions that may be relevant as regards natural persons in the management body of a Swedish firm are prohibition of exercising management functions in an investment firm and financial penalties. Financial penalties for natural persons are to be set at a maximum of an amount corresponding to EUR 5 million or, where the amount is higher and can be determined, at twice the amount of the benefit derived from the infringement.</p>
<p>The provision concerning intervention against natural persons in an investment firm´s or market operator´s management body is also to be applied to foreign firms situated outside the EEA and conducting securities operations from a branch in Sweden, in which case it shall be possible to impose a financial penalty on the person or person responsible for management of the branch.</p>
<p>The new system of sanctions also affects the decision-making procedure for sanctions. The Inquiry proposes that Finansinspektionen, as before, is to decide on sanctions referring to legal persons, and also on matters concerning natural persons’ failure to report acquisitions and disposals of a qualified holding in an investment firm, a market operator or a Swedish clearing organisation. As regards sanctions against natural persons responsible in a Swedish investment firm or a market operator, as regards infringements on the part of the firm, Finanspektionen is to consider sanctions issues through sanctions orders. If such an order is not approved within the period prescribed Finansinspektionen may apply to the County Administrative Court in Stockholm for the sanction to be decided.</p>
<h2>Entry into force and transitional provisions (Chapter 14)</h2>
<p>Under MiFID II Member States shall adopt and publish, by 3 July 2016, the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with the Directive. The national provisions are to be applied as of 3 January 2017, with some exceptions. With some exceptions, MiFIR is to start to be applied as of 3 January 2017. Regarding MiFIR, this means that the current provisions in Swedish legislation that correspond to the provisions of MiFIR are to cease to apply on 3 January 2017. No special measures in other respects to ensure that the Regulation starts to be applied in Sweden will be taken and no transitional provisions are necessary. As regards MiFID II, the amendments to the Securities Market Act proposed by the Inquiry will come into force on 3 January 2017, with the exception of the provisions on the obligation of a CTP to collect and publish information on trading in bonds, structured financial products, emission allowances and derivatives. These rules will be applied as of 3 September 2018.</p>
