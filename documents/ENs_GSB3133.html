<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>During the spring of 2003, the EU Commission, the Council and the EU Parliament were preparing a directive (2003/30/EC) about the promotion of biofuels and other renewable fuels (the “biofuels” directive). The directive was published on May 17, 2003. The directive implies that the member states should take actions so that a certain share of the total sales of petrol and diesel fuel should be biofuels. As a reference level for the Union as a whole, two per cent, calculated on energy basis, of the biofuels sold should, at the latest by December 31 2005, be biofuels. In 2010, the total share of biofuels should be 5,75 % of the fuels sold. The directive does not stipulate in which way the member states should promote the use of biofuels.</p>
<p>The biofuels directive which, in combination with the directives for the Committee, was the basis of the commission of this Committee has the aim to contribute to that several targets are fulfilled. Such target are, e.g. to fulfil obligations regarding climate change, to increase the security of energy supply in an environmentally friendly way and to promote renewable energy sources.</p>
<p>In January 2004 I submitted the interim report ” Förnybara fordonsbränslen – nationellt mål för 2005 och hur tillgängligheten av dessa bränslen kan ökas”  (SOU 2004:4, with a summary in English). In the interim report, two main areas were covered, i.e. the national target for 2005 and a proposed bill to increase the availability of renewable motor fuels.</p>
<p>Two Swedish investigations of particular interest could be mentioned. The first covers road taxes and its final report was presented in May 2004, the second covers flexible mechanisms and its final report is to be finished by the end of 2004. Working with this report, I have followed the progress within the two Committees mentioned above.</p>
<p>The international development in this area and within the EU in particular, has been of great interest. On an international basis, ethanol is the renewable motor fuel that is mostly used. On the contrary, rapeseed methyl ester (RME) is dominating in the EU, although the use of ethanol has increased during the last years. In an international perspective, biogas, which is of considerable interest in Sweden, is used marginally. In the future, the biofuels that are usually denoted as the second generation of biofuels (see definition below), are expected to play a greater role.</p>
<p>The time perspectives used in this final report are the following:</p>
<p>• Short term: about 5 years</p>
<p>• Mid term: about 10 years</p>
<p>• Long term: >25 years</p>
<p>Three generations of biofuels can be perceived today. They are:</p>
<p>• The first generation is the biofuels that are available today, such as, e.g. biogas, ethanol and rapeseed methyl ester (RME).</p>
<p>• Second generation biofuels are among other things considered to be fuels produced via gasification of biomass and ethanol from lignocellulosic matter. The classification is somewhat more uncertain in this case compared to the first case.</p>
<p>• As third generation of biofuels, hydrogen, or some other new biofuel alternative, could be considered.</p>
<p>The time horizon for the three different generations of biofuels is approximately the same as for the previously mentioned time perspectives.</p>
<h2>Various routes to reach the target for 2010</h2>
<p>In Sweden, as well as in the EU and internationally, there is a vast feedstock potential for the production of renewable motor fuels that is currently not utilised. A competition for these feedstocks will not arise on the time horizon to 2010, other than possibly, locally. On a longer term, the competition will likely increase and then a decision about the best route to utilise the feedstock has to be made.</p>
<p>The stakeholders for biofuels in Sweden have tangible and funded plans today for an increase of the production capacity for biofuels corresponding to about 1 TWh in 2010. Biogas and RME are completely dominating this volume. Other biofuels can be imported at a lower cost than for the corresponding biofuels produced in Sweden. The dominating import volume is expected to be ethanol from Brazil. Cost efficiency and system efficiency in a lifecycle perspective is better for this ethanol than for most motor fuels produced in Sweden, so this import has to be accepted.</p>
<p>In order to investigate the possibilities for Sweden to reach the target proposed by the EU for 2010, three different scenarios have been studied. The base scenario can fulfil the EU indicative target for a substitution of petrol and diesel fuel corresponding to 5,75 % on an energy basis in 2010. The two main barriers that have to be overcome to reach the target are an increase in the blending rate of rapeseed methyl ester (or other esters of this kind) in diesel fuel up to 5 % and an increase in the blending rate of alcohols in petrol beyond the 5 % ethanol already blended today in Sweden. I presume that Swedish specifications and quality control for diesel fuel can be changed so that the barrier mentioned first can be overcome. A revision of the limits for alcohol blending in petrol can only be decided in the EU.</p>
<p>The sales of so called “biofuel cars”, e.g. cars that can be fuelled with renewable motor fuels, must increase substantially to enable that the target for 2010 can be reached, unless the low level blending of alcohols in petrol can be increased.</p>
<h2>Green certificates</h2>
<p>In the directives to the Committee, it is stated that the Committee should investigate the possibilities to introduce some kind of green certificates for motor fuels. The tax relief for biofuels decided by the parliament should also be followed up carefully.</p>
<p>In the final report, a great attention is paid to the tax relief for biofuels. The advantage of a tax relief is that, so far, it has led to a considerable increase in the use of biofuels. For example, up to 5 % ethanol is blended in most of the petrol with an octane number of 95. A higher blending rate cannot be utilised with regard to the current fuel specifications.</p>
<p>The tax relief has, however, led to a relatively substantial overcompensation for imported ethanol used in low level blending. The energy tax directive, article 16.3, states that overcompensation is not allowed. This, in addition to other reasons described in more detail in this report, results in that the conclusion can be drawn that there are reasons to consider other financial incentives.</p>
<p>The tax on carbon dioxide and the trade with emission credits are, on an overall level, cost-effective incentives. They are aiming at the emissions of carbon dioxide regardless of where the emissions are generated and the source of the emissions. Since the specific target is to increase the share of biofuels in the transport sector, a system with green certificates appears to be more adapted to this purpose.</p>
<p>Green certificates have already been established in the electricity sector and the experiences from the electricity certificate system are of course important when the conditions for a certificate system for motor fuels are investigated. The market for certificates is an artificial market. It is important that the pricing of the certificates is working in a satisfactory way.</p>
<p>It is proposed that those in charge of the quota duty are the same as those in charge of the purchase tax according to the energy tax law. Biofuels are not included in the quota duty obligation.</p>
<p>In the interim report it was stated that the difference between the electricity sector and the motor fuel sector is great. However, the collected information in this respect does not constitute a cause to the assumption that the system for green certificates cannot be used as an incentive for the motor fuel sector.</p>
<p>In the motor fuel certificate system it is proposed that the authorized allocation should be made for imported as well as for domestically produced biofuels. The allocation can only be made to Swedish natural persons or to juridical persons. In this way, the number of technologies and quantities of fuel can be increased, which is a guarantee for a cost-effective certificate system. Thus, the system will not be a business grant in a proper sense but an incentive to reach a certain market share of biofuels.</p>
<p>A certificate system for motor fuels could, after further investigatory work, come into force from January 1, 2009. Then the tax relief will be replaced by the certificate system for motor fuels. A transitional period when green certificates and a system for tax relief are coexisting side by side could be necessary.</p>
<p>In summary, the certificate system should be founded on the following principles:</p>
<p>• Those who produce or import a renewable fuel will receive a certificate for each MWh that the fuel corresponds to.</p>
<p>• Everyone who sells fuel to an end consumer is obliged to buy a certain number of certificates according to his sales, a  so-called quota duty.</p>
<p>• Those who have not complied with their duties according to the quota duty are imposed by economic sanctions.</p>
<p>• The certificates should, corresponding to the sales of fossil fuels, be accounted for to the state at a given date and be cancelled. The certificates can be saved and should be considered as a valuable paper (financial instrument).</p>
<p>• The quota duty will gradually be increased and it will lead to an increased demand for certificates and thus for renewable motor fuels.</p>
<p>• By selling certificates the stakeholders on the market are encouraged to produce or import more renewable motor fuels.</p>
<p>• The fuel certificate system will provide for  long-term stable economic rules in comparison to tax subsidies that can be changed on short notice.</p>
<p>• The certificate system will create competition between various renewable fuels, which in turn will imply that it will be to the benefit of the customers.</p>
<p>• The system should also lead to an interest in developing new cheap renewable motor fuels.</p>
<p>• The tax incentives cease to exist – alternatively they are phased out – when the system is introduced.</p>
<h2>Research, development and demonstration</h2>
<p>As a complement to economic incentives, as among others green certificates, I am proposing Governmental grants for research, development and demonstration. This is an important part of a future strategy, since economic incentives can lead to that motor fuels that are available on short-term and that are providing the lowest incremental cost compared to petrol and diesel fuel today are given priority. These motor fuels are not necessarily “best” on long term.</p>
<p>The research conducted in the field of renewable motor fuels has decreased considerably during the last years and a new great investment is necessary for the technology shift implied by the substitution of traditional fossil by carbon neutral fuels.</p>
<p>The programme for research, development and demonstration I am proposing comprise in average about SEK 150 million annually during the period from 2006 to 2010. The funding for this programme can be provided by raising the fuel taxes on fossil fuels; after that considerable resources will be available from the tax relief that is proposed to cease or be phased out. The Swedish Energy Agency is proposed to be responsible for the co-ordination of this programme.</p>
<h2>Consequences</h2>
<p>The cost-effectiveness in production and use of renewable motor fuels with the aim of reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases is lower than in other sectors today. However, on a longer term, there are possibilities to drastically reduce the cost and since the transport sector is predicted to grow considerably in the future, actions have to be taken in this sector. Nevertheless, my assessment is that the basis for carrying out calculations of future cost reductions still is not adequate.</p>
<p>In order to meet the proposed target of 5,75 % biofuels in 2010 the tax income will, provided that the tax relief will continue, be reduced by almost SEK 2,2 billion compared to the case if no substitution had been made at all. This is about one billion SEK more than the reduction for reaching the target of 3 % in 2005.</p>
<p>The proposals I have put forward will to a certain extent improve the energy security and the employment and in addition, create conditions for a diversification of the trade and industry. Since the import of biofuels will dominate the supply, the positive effects in this respect will decrease.</p>
<p>The impact on exhaust emissions (besides CO ) with detrimental effects on health and environment by a transition to renewable motor fuels are moderately low for light-duty vehicles but in some cases they are somewhat higher for heavy-duty vehicles. The cause of the relatively small advantage in the first case is that the emissions from conventional fuels, such as petrol and diesel fuel, will be drastically reduced by new and future exhaust emission limits. In some cases there are also negative consequences from a transition to biofuels. In specific cases, where the problems with local air quality are considerable, biofuels (and other alternative fuels) can be motivated by environmental concern. Overall, the impact on exhaust emissions is so low that the positive impact on CO and other climate gases is the primary environmental objective for the introduction of biofuels.</p>
<h2>Considerations and proposals</h2>
<p>My proposals and considerations can be summarised in the following bullet list:</p>
<p>• I propose that a substitution of petrol and diesel fuel corresponding to 5,75 % on an energy basis will be set as the national Swedish target for 2010. The target can be achieved with the conditions assumed for the base scenario but there are also alternative routes. The simplest way to reach the target would be if the limit for low level blending of ethanol in petrol could be increased.</p>
<p>• I recommend an increase in the level of ethanol blending in petrol from 5 % to 10 % and for rapeseed methyl ester (and other esters) in diesel fuel from the current practical limit of about 2 % to 5 %. In the ethanol case, a modification of the petrol specification in the EU is required, while a national decision is required in the rapeseed methyl ester case.</p>
<p>• I recommend that green certificates are introduced as an economic incentive and that the tax relief is discontinued or phased out. However, additional detailed investigations will be required before green certificates could be implemented in practice.</p>
<p>• I propose that the tax relief is discontinued after 2008.</p>
<p>• Part of the resources made available by the discontinuation of the tax relief should be utilised for funding research, development and demonstration projects. The extent of the proposed programme during the period from 2006 to 2009 will be about SEK 150 million annually. I am proposing that the Swedish Energy Agency resume the responsibility for coordination this programme.</p>
<p>• The main part of the resources for research, development and demonstration mentioned above will be used for funding the development of the second generation biofuels.</p>
