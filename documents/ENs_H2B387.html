<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Remit</h2>
<p>The Inquiry’s remit was to review certain issues concerning pricing, availability and market conditions in the pharmaceuticals and pharmacies area.</p>
<p>This final report deals with the parts of the remit that concern trade in pharmaceutical products for animals, automated dose dispensing of pharmaceuticals and pricing of orphan medicinal products.</p>
<p>The Inquiry was instructed to:</p>
<p>• analyse and submit proposals on how to improve availability of pharmaceuticals for animals and the regulatory framework concerning trade in these pharmaceuticals;</p>
<p>• review the legal regulations that apply to automated dose dispensing of pharmaceuticals and submit proposals that, among other things, could lead to favourable conditions for effective competition and good availability; and</p>
<p>• illustrate how orphan medicinal products should be priced and, if necessary, propose a separate pricing model.</p>
<h2>Trade in pharmaceuticals for animals Background and points of departure (Chapter 4)</h2>
<p>The market for pharmaceuticals for animals is relatively small and accounted for approximately 2 per cent of pharmacies’ total sales in 2012. The market consists of two sub-markets, whose conditions differ: farm animals owned and kept by professional animal owners running a business, and pets that are sometimes on permanent medication.</p>
<p>Veterinary care is provided by veterinary practices run by both state and private actors.</p>
<p>The public sector does not cover the costs of treating animals; instead, the costs must be covered by the animal’s owner, who can insure his or her animals.</p>
<p>Total sales of pharmaceuticals for animals amounted to just over SEK 750 million in 2012. Of these, approximately SEK 400 million was accounted for by prescribed pharmaceuticals, just over SEK 150 million by pharmaceuticals for self-care and slightly more than SEK 150 million by pharmaceuticals obtained for use in veterinary practices.</p>
<p>In the treatment of animals, veterinary medicinal products are primarily used, but pharmaceuticals for human use may also be used. The choice of pharmaceutical should follow the ‘cascade principle’.</p>
<p>In 2013, more than 850 approved pharmaceuticals for veterinary use were available in Sweden, most of them original pharmaceutical products. Of the approved pharmaceuticals, 34 were non-prescription and 45 were non-prescription, depending on the packaging size. This means that approximately 90 per cent of all approved pharmaceuticals for veterinary use are prescription-only.</p>
<p>The distribution of pharmaceuticals for animals occurs in largely the same way as for people. However, one difference is that unlike hospitals, veterinary practices can only buy pharmaceuticals from pharmacies. The exception is vaccines and serums, which wholesalers can sell to, among others, veterinarians.</p>
<p>Pharmaceuticals for veterinary use is largely a harmonised area as a result of Directive 2001/82/EC of 6 November 2001 on the Community code relating to veterinary medicinal products. The Directive has been amended on a number of occasions and is currently under review.</p>
<h2>Deliberations and proposals (Chapter 5)</h2>
<h2>Animal pharmacies</h2>
<p>All retail pharmacies (öppenvårdsapotek) have an obligation to provide pharmaceuticals for animals; a few actors currently specialise in pharmaceuticals for animals. Setting different requirements for pharmacies that sell only pharmaceuticals for animals would reasonably mean that the requirements for other retail pharmacies should be adjusted. The Inquiry considers that a number of specialised pharmacies might increase availability of pharmaceuticals locally or for a certain group of animal owners. Though to meet the need for pharmaceuticals in different parts of the country and the needs of different kinds of animal owners, the obligation on the part of all retail pharmacies to provide all prescribed pharmaceuticals for animals should remain in place.</p>
<p>As specialisation has proved possible within the framework of the current regulations for retail pharmacies, the Inquiry sees no reason to create any special regulatory framework for pharmacies that only sell pharmaceuticals for animals.</p>
<h2>Licence to run a retail pharmacy</h2>
<p>The Inquiry has concluded that no changes should be made concerning the groups that may not be granted a licence to run a retail pharmacy. It is not possible to disregard the risk that veterinarians being able to run retail pharmacies may affect prescription patterns and the tendency to prescribe pharmaceuticals, e.g. with regard to prescribing antibiotics. In addition, the Inquiry considers that changes to the groups not permitted to run retail pharmacies would not bring about any considerable increase in the availability of pharmaceuticals for animals.</p>
<h2>Obligation to provide pharmaceuticals</h2>
<p>No stricter requirements should be introduced concerning the obligation to provide, supply and stock pharmaceuticals for animals than the requirements that currently apply.</p>
<p>Several measures have recently been introduced to make it easier for consumers to quickly and easily obtain prescribed pharmaceuticals, e.g. a system for checking in-stock status and the obligation for pharmacies to inform customers where a pharmaceutical product is in stock. The meaning of the obligation to provide pharmaceuticals has now been defined more closely. Moreover, the scope for veterinarians to provide emergency doses for the treatment of animals is greater than that for the treatment of humans.</p>
<p>Requirements on stock-keeping have been considered but are deemed difficult to implement. The Inquiry considers that the supply obligation for wholesalers should not be made more stringent as it would probably result in increased costs. Moreover, it is doubtful whether this would be compatible with EU law in the area. Regulations concerning the obligation on the part of pharmacies to provide information to the Swedish eHealth Agency and the Swedish eHealth Agency’s obligation to provide information to the Medical Products Agency proposed by the Inquiry would improve the conditions for monitoring the obligation to provide pharmaceuticals. Dialogue between pharmacies and veterinarians on which pharmaceuticals should be available at pharmacies should also be possible.</p>
<h2>Pharmaceuticals from wholesalers</h2>
<p>The Inquiry considers that the possibility should not be introduced for veterinary practices to acquire pharmaceuticals directly from wholesalers, beyond the current rules concerning vaccines and serums. This kind of structure risks resulting in a lack of sales for retail pharmacies, which may, in turn, reduce the availability of pharmaceuticals for animals and possibly even lead to increased prices for animal owners and veterinarians who cannot make purchases through wholesalers.</p>
<h2>Sale of certain non-prescription pharmaceuticals</h2>
<p>The Inquiry has decided not to propose that certain non-prescription pharmaceuticals for animals be sold at outlets other than retail pharmacies. The Inquiry’s analysis indicates that this kind of sales structure could be considered for only a few pharmaceutical products. We do not anticipate that this would lead to any appreciable increase in the availability of pharmaceuticals. The administrative burden and the costs the procedure would entail for business owners and the licensing and supervisory agencies are not considered proportionate to the benefits of this kind of system. This applies regardless of whether it is a question of a notification procedure or licence requirements.</p>
<h2>Availability of approved veterinary medicinal products</h2>
<p>The Inquiry’s analysis indicates that compliance with the cascade principle when prescribing pharmaceuticals is relatively good. However, we consider that the supervisory agencies need better data to be able to monitor prescriptions.</p>
<p>The Swedish Board of Agriculture, the county administrative boards and individual veterinarians should be given access by the Swedish eHealth Agency to information on individual veterinarians’ prescriptions – this is described in more detail in the next chapter. This would contribute to better compliance with, and monitoring of, the cascade principle. Veterinarian numbers should be required on all kinds of prescriptions for pharmaceuticals for animals and this should be stated in the Medical Products Agency’s regulations.</p>
<p>Measures should also be taken to improve knowledge about the cascade principle, which pharmaceuticals range is available and which pharmaceuticals should not be prescribed.</p>
<p>Which pharmaceuticals are subject to applications for a special licence from the Medical Products Agency reflects the choice of the pharmaceutical companies to apply for approval for particular pharmaceuticals or to have them delisted. Availability of approved veterinary medicinal products is influenced by the extent to which they are prescribed, but it can also be influenced by the requirements set, for example, in terms of labelling and various charges. The Medical Products Agency should review how it applies the labelling requirements for pharmaceuticals for veterinary use. In the negotiations on the regulatory framework for pharmaceuticals for veterinary use, the Government should work actively to ensure that the labelling requirements, as far as possible, are designed so as not to counter the companies’ incentives to apply for the approval of pharmaceuticals intended for animals.</p>
<p>In accordance with Article 7 of Directive 2001/82/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Community code relating to veterinary medicinal products, the Medical Products Agency should be able to issue licences for the sale of pharmaceuticals for veterinary use that are not approved in Sweden but in another EEA state, if the health situation requires this. This possibility should be described in more detail in the Medicinal Products Ordinance (2006:272).</p>
<h2>Matters concerning prescription databases and statistics</h2>
<p>The current national prescription database for animals should remain in place and the Swedish eHealth Agency should retain responsibility for the database.</p>
<p>As to prescriptions for pharmaceuticals for animals, no special requirements for retail pharmacies’ prescription dispensing systems should be introduced.</p>
<p>Retail pharmacies currently provide information to the Swedish eHealth Agency on prescriptions dispensed for animals. The Inquiry proposes that this become an obligation by law.</p>
<p>The Medical Products Agency should be instructed to review the prescription regulations (LVFS 2009:13) concerning which information should be required for a prescription for pharmaceuticals for animals to be considered valid.</p>
<p>It should be specified in an ordinance that the Swedish eHealth Agency is to provide information to:</p>
<p>• veterinarians about their own prescriptions;</p>
<p>• the Swedish Board of Agriculture and the county administrative boards for supervision of the veterinary prescription of pharmaceuticals; and</p>
<p>• the Medical Products Agency for supervision of the obligation of retail pharmacies to provide pharmaceuticals for animals.</p>
<p>We propose a new provision in the Medicinal Products Trading Act stating that the Swedish eHealth Agency is permitted to charge a fee to cover the costs of maintaining a national database of electronic prescriptions for animals. This fee should be charged to the licence holder. The government will decide on the amount of the fee.</p>
<p>The Swedish eHealth Agency should continue to manage, compile and provide national pharmaceutical statistics on pharmaceuticals intended for animals.</p>
<p>The Swedish eHealth Agency should be instructed to clarify which information on the sale of pharmaceuticals for animals it can provide and identify which additional statistical data should be collected.</p>
<p>In line with its instructions, the Swedish eHealth Agency should also continue to charge fees for providing pharmaceutical statistics and systems for analysing such statistics. The Inquiry considers that this system can continue pending a review by the eHealth Committee of the Swedish eHealth Agency’s fees and financing model.</p>
<h2>Registration of certain information</h2>
<p>Under the remit, the Inquiry is to propose how Article 66.2 of Directive 2001/82/EC can be implemented in Swedish law with regard to all actors who have a licence to sell pharmaceuticals for animals.</p>
<p>The Inquiry notes that the requirements of the Directive have already been largely met in Swedish law. Implementation of the requirements yet to be implemented should be achieved through amendments to the Medical Products Agency’s regulations.</p>
<p>Veterinary provision of emergency doses should not be covered by the requirements for documentation under Article 66.2.</p>
<p>There should be greater awareness among animal owners and veterinarians that pharmaceutical prices can vary between pharmacies and that there are possibilities to compare prices. Pharmacies should strive to provide easily accessible price information.</p>
<p>If changes are made to how prices and price information are dealt with concerning pharmaceuticals for human use not covered by the pharmaceutical reimbursement system, it should be considered if pharmaceuticals for animals could be dealt with in the same way.</p>
<h2>Supervision</h2>
<p>The Inquiry considers that the supervision conducted by the Health and Social Care Inspectorate should also cover pharmacy staff who manufacture or dispense pharmaceuticals for animals or give advice or information. To make this clear for those concerned, the instructions of the Health and Social Care Inspectorate should state clearly that this is included in its supervision of health and medical care staff.</p>
<h2>Consequences</h2>
<p>Our proposals do not entail any major changes for animal owners. With regard to availability, the Inquiry highlights that measures such as the introduction of an obligation to provide information and search systems for in-stock status have also improved the situation for animal owners. The proposals on regulating information about the dispensing of pharmaceuticals for animals require measures by the Swedish eHealth Agency, the Medical Products Agency and the Swedish Board of Agriculture, but they would improve opportunities for monitoring and supervision. It will only be possible to foresee the consequences for veterinarians and retail pharmacies following an analysis of what is to be reported and how this is to be done. For the Health and Social Care Inspectorate, the Inquiry’s proposals on clarifying supervisory responsibility indicate that its supervisory work may need adapting.</p>
<h2>Automated dose dispensing Background and points of departure (Chapter 7)</h2>
<p>Dose dispensing means preparing pharmaceuticals for the needs of an individual patient for a given period by removing them from the manufacturer’s original packaging. Automated dose dispensing means that pharmaceuticals are repacked into dose bags that are labelled with information about the patient and the pharmaceutical product contained in the bag. Automated dose dispensing is regarded as manufacturing.</p>
<p>Automated dose dispensing is procured by the county councils. The county councils previously had contracts with Apoteket AB (the National Corporation of Swedish Pharmacies) for this. Three actors currently have contracts with individual county councils for the provision of automated dose dispensing. One hospital carries out automated dose dispensing for its own inpatient care needs. The number of patients who receive pharmaceuticals dispensed in doses (dose patients) has long been just under 200 000; many of these patients reside in the municipalities’ special forms of housing. The Swedish Prison and Probation Service also procures automated dose dispensing.</p>
<p>These pharmaceuticals are paid for in the same way as regular outpatient pharmaceuticals. The county councils pay the dose providers for dose dispensing – known as the ‘dose payment’. This payment amounts to an estimated total of SEK 226 million based on the number of patients in 2011.</p>
<p>The substitution rules in the pharmaceutical reimbursement system also apply to automatedly dispensed pharmaceuticals, but they are difficult and expensive to apply. Sometimes substitution does not occur, and so the savings the pharmaceuticals reimbursement system aims to achieve do not occur.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s point of departure was that the proposals submitted are to help maintain good availability and support equitable care throughout the country, while ensuring that effective cost control is possible. Moreover, the Inquiry has endeavoured to use common solutions and to adapt the proposals as far as possible to the structures that apply to outpatient pharmaceuticals in general.</p>
<h2>Deliberations and proposals (Chapter 8)</h2>
<p>Automated dose dispensing should continue to be regarded as manufacturing under the Medicinal Products Act (1992:859). Anyone wanting to conduct automated dose dispensing must have a licence from the Medical Products Agency.</p>
<p>Licences may only be granted to those who have been granted a licence to run a retail pharmacy, or other care providers. In future too, applicants must be required to demonstrate that they are able to meet the requirements under Section 15, second paragraph of the Medicinal Products Act.</p>
<p>A licence is valid indefinitely and is issued to a particular retail pharmacy or, in the case of another care provider, a particular department for automated dose dispensing. Licences granted to care providers other than retail pharmacies may only meet the need for automated dose dispensing in inpatient care within that particular organisation.</p>
<p>The requirements concerning automated dose dispensing in the current regulations should remain in place. Only the retail pharmacies conducting automated dose dispensing should have an obligation to provide automatedly dispensed pharmaceuticals. However, the ‘24-hour rule’ should not apply to automatedly dispensed pharmaceuticals.</p>
<p>The information regarding medication provided to the patient should be improved through requirements for medication reviews for dose patients.</p>
<p>It is very important that all retail pharmacies conducting automated dose dispensing compete on equal terms.</p>
<p>The model of pharmaceutical substitution and the construction of the pharmacies’ retail mark-up in the pharmaceutical reimbursement system are not adapted to dose dispensing. The requirements concerning frequent changes in the range stocked when the ‘product of the period’ is changed lead to practical problems and costs for actors dispensing doses. Another problem is that packaging intended only for automated dose dispensing may be the ‘product of the period’ and must therefore be dispensed at regular retail pharmacies. However, the limited patient information provided with these pharmaceuticals means that they are not allowed to be dispensed to a patient by a retail pharmacy.</p>
<p>The Inquiry has analysed alternative ways of addressing these problems. The Inquiry’s conclusion is that the pharmaceutical reimbursement system should continue to apply to automatedly dispensed pharmaceuticals, but that the substitution regulations should be adapted to doses. An actor involved in automated dose dispensing may substitute automatedly dispensed pharmaceuticals, but does not have to do so. A special pricing model, based on the lowest substance prices that the generic substitute would result in, should be applied to automatedly dispensed pharmaceuticals. This pricing model would mean that dose pharmacies must be allowed to negotiate the purchase price.</p>
<p>If it is not considered possible to implement the Inquiry’s main proposal, one alternative may be to draw up a separate ‘product of the period’ list intended to be used for automatedly dispensed pharmaceuticals. The current ‘product of the period’ system will continue to apply and the substitution requirement will remain in place.</p>
<p>Regardless of which model is chosen, the retail mark-up for automatedly dispensed pharmaceuticals should be reviewed.</p>
<p>The Inquiry also describes three additional alternative ways of pricing pharmaceuticals for automated dose dispensing: allowing longer price periods for the ‘product of the period’; having retail pharmacies bear the cost when substitution does not occur; or the county councils taking over responsibility for automatedly dispensed pharmaceuticals, thus removing them from the pharmaceutical reimbursement system. However, the Inquiry’s view is that the advantages of these alternatives do not outweigh the disadvantages.</p>
<p>On the whole, the proposal on regulating automated dose dispensing would not entail any major changes for patients, county councils and the actors currently conducting dose dispensing. The proposals for a new pricing model would mean more savings for the public sector than at present. The proposals would involve more administration for the Dental and Pharmaceutical Benefits Agency. For the few dose dispensing actors currently in the market, this means that they would have the right to negotiate the purchase price for pharmaceuticals to be used for automated dose dispensing. The Inquiry considers that the right to negotiate would only have a negative impact on the market if the number of dose patients increases considerably.</p>
<h2>Orphan medicinal products Background and points of departure (Chapter 9)</h2>
<p>Orphan medicinal products are pharmaceuticals intended for patients with rare and serious illnesses and defined as such under a special EU Regulation (141/2000/EC). These pharmaceuticals are often very expensive, especially as the development costs are spread across a very limited number of patients. The EU Regulation allows for favourable treatment of these pharmaceuticals in certain respects. The number of orphan medicinal products is constantly rising. In 2013, the cost of orphan medicinal products amounted to SEK 826 million.</p>
<p>To date, most applications for inclusion in the reimbursement system for orphan medicinal products have been approved by the Dental and Pharmaceutical Benefits Agency, but in a few cases an application was rejected because the cost was considered too high. The current reimbursement system poses certain difficulties in dealing with both orphan medicinal products and other pharmaceuticals for rare illnesses.</p>
<p>The points of departure for the Inquiry’s deliberations and proposals have been to strive for good availability in the form of good access to relevant and crucial treatment, equal opportunities to receive care throughout the country, and cost control. Cost control means having a system in place that meets the needs of public health care for a negotiating position and an effective role as buyer. In this respect, the Inquiry also considers it important to build on existing solutions and structures.</p>
<h2>Deliberations and proposals (Chapter 10)</h2>
<p>The Inquiry’s interpretation of the remit is that proposed solutions should focus on the problem of excessively high costs of pharmaceuticals intended for very small patient groups with serious illnesses, even though these pharmaceuticals have not always been defined as orphan medicinal products.</p>
<p>The Inquiry has identified three alternative courses of action to address the problem of high costs for pharmaceuticals intended for serious illnesses among small patient groups:</p>
<p>• maintain the existing pricing model, also for this group, but with a higher threshold than is currently accepted;</p>
<p>• design a special pricing model for carefully defined pharmaceutical categories or patient groups; or</p>
<p>• create an alternative way of valuing and financing pharmaceuticals that may not otherwise be used by the patients who need them.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that for certain pharmaceuticals that cannot be subsidised in the regular procedure, the possibility should be introduced to subsidise them under a special procedure. This would mean that the Dental and Pharmaceutical Benefits Agency, together with the county councils and the company concerned, would agree on more detailed terms for the subsidy decision. In such cases, the Dental and Pharmaceutical Benefits Agency should be able to initiate special talks between companies and county councils to agree on the terms that should apply for a pharmaceutical product to be included in the pharmaceutical reimbursement system and which price should apply.</p>
<p>For the Dental and Pharmaceutical Benefits Agency to take such an initiative, a pharmaceutical product considered not eligible for subsidy under the normal procedure must meet certain set criteria in terms of patient numbers, characteristics of the illness, long-term/lifelong treatment, lack of other relevant treatment, etc. However, this does not mean that such a pharmaceutical product would automatically be offered to a patient; it simply means that the product would be the subject of a special review.</p>
<p>In this model, outpatient pharmaceutical products are distributed through retail pharmacies and are included in the pharmaceutical reimbursement system at a uniform price throughout the country without needing to meet the conditions laid down in Section 15 of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Act (2002:160).</p>
<p>Under the proposal, the Agency’s decision would have to be linked to special terms. Examples of terms that may be relevant are follow-up requirements of various kinds, time limits, repayment due to lack of effect, renegotiation times for pricing, volume limits, etc. As the conditions of one pharmaceutical product can be completely different from those of another, it is important that there is scope for the parties involved to adapt the terms to the conditions in each individual case.</p>
<p>In connection with the talks referred to in the proposal, the Dental and Pharmaceutical Benefits Agency may need to disclose information submitted to it to the county councils and the applicant. The Inquiry proposes an amendment to the Public Access to Information and Secrecy Act (2009:400) so that the secrecy that applies to the Dental and Pharmaceutical Benefits Agency concerning such information would also apply to the county councils when information is disclosed to them.</p>
<h2>Consequences</h2>
<p>New opportunities will be created for equitable care for the patients affected and for better access for care providers to new and innovative treatments. As the number of pharmaceutical products affected by the proposal will be small – an estimated two to three per year – the Inquiry considers that the costs to the public purse for the pharmaceutical reimbursement system will increase only marginally. However, the Dental and Pharmaceutical Benefits Agency will need to set aside resources for regulatory work, management of the necessary negotiations and similar issues.</p>
<h2>Entry into force (Chapter 11)</h2>
<p>It is recommended that the proposals enter into force on 1 July 2016, with a few exceptions.</p>
