<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Comprehensive review of working methods and agency structures</h2>
<p>The Government’s Inquiry on the Health Care and Social Services has been assigned the task of developing the health care and social services system by reviewing the role of the state and its governance. The focus of this interim report are the issues that the health care and social services need to be able to deal with in a tento fifteen-year perspective, and the role that the state should play in these issues.</p>
<p>Based on an analysis of the situation and challenges of today, we highlight some of the issues that we will be focusing upon in our further work. These involve areas in which the state, in various ways, needs to develop its role and governance in relation to changes in the world around us. In our further work, several more questions may be brought to the fore.</p>
<p>Our assessments has led us to see a need for a comprehensive review of the way in which the state governs and supports the health care and social services system. This means, among other things, that the structure of agencies needs to be re-examined. The division of responsibilities needs to be clarified, working procedures to be modernised, and management and staff skills to be further developed. Since some of the problems in the present state governance are due to the fact that there are overlaps between agencies with similar duties, we consider that more effective state governance can be achieved without additional resources.</p>
<h2>Long-term conditions that create forces for change</h2>
<p>We consider that five factors are of particular importance for the health care and social services. These forces for change mean that both the services themselves, and the governance and role of the state in the system, need to be developed. These factors also create new conditions for state governance, but also for local and regional political governance. For municipalities and county councils, it will be a challenge to renew local and regional health care and social services policies, based on these new conditions.</p>
<h2>1. The resources challenge</h2>
<p>Both demographic developments and increased opportunities for offering high-quality health care and social services entail challenges for public funding. Measures to increase efficiency and an active discussion on priorities are needed in many areas. In connection with this, the discussion on equal health care and, ultimately, what citizens are entitled to demand of publicly-funded health care and social services is brought to the fore.</p>
<h2>2. Internationalisation</h2>
<p>Increased international mobility also creates new conditions for the health care and social services. Knowledge and experience are spread more rapidly; both patients, users and professionals are increasingly moving across national borders. The international regulatory framework is also becoming increasingly important in a growing number of areas. Companies within the health care and social services sector are also becoming internationalised.</p>
<h2>3. Knowledge and IT developments</h2>
<p>A fundamental condition for the governance of knowledge is access to up-to-date, comparable data. IT developments provide increased opportunities, both for disseminating and developing knowledge, and for simplifying administration. At the same time, partially new issues arise, such as those related to striking a balance between personal integrity and effective information management.</p>
<h2>4. Patients and users can, and want to have more power over their own health care and social services</h2>
<p>We see a long-term development towards patients and users both wanting, and being able to deal with, greater power of their own. There is much to indicate that this change will be one of the greatest challenges and forces for change facing the health care and social services sector. The differences are, however, considerable. Different groups of patients and users have different needs and interests. Different political values are also important.</p>
<h2>5. Greater diversity in production and funding</h2>
<p>Despite the fact that the differences within the country are large, we see that the proportion of publicly-funded health care and social services operated in independent forms is growing, but the necessary conditions in terms of regulatory frameworks, governance, operational development and supervision have not been adapted to a sufficient extent.</p>
<p>Regulation that includes the sectors of the health care and social services that are entirely privately-funded may also need to be adapted and developed.</p>
<h2>The focus of the Inquiry ’ s further work</h2>
<p>In the Inquiry’s further work we will try to make suggestions for ways in which the state can govern and support the health care and social services to deal with the changes that we have described.</p>
<h2>Coordination for health care and social services on equal terms</h2>
<p>In our work, we have seen how needs for more national coordination to ensure equal terms have been growing in recent years, within both the health care system and the social services. One of the reasons for the more intensive discussion on equal terms is greater access to information on the range of services, fees and results. Another reason is the greater freedom of choice and diversity within the health care and social services. Mobility and internationalisation are also contributory factors, as is the financial challenge facing the health care and social services.</p>
<h2>Better support for patientand user-empowerment</h2>
<p>As patients, users and relatives will take more active part, they will also need better support to make choices and participate in different ways. Municipalities and County Councils are responsible for information and guidance to their citizens, but many of the databases and IT-systems has to be developed in national cooperation.</p>
<h2>Coordination for quality and efficiency</h2>
<p>Sweden is a comparatively small country in terms of population size, but is large in terms of its area. We consider that more national coordination is required in order to deal with some of the challenges facing the health care and social services in the future.</p>
<p>The opportunities and problems arising as a result of IT developments require clearer regulatory frameworks and more compatible, user-friendly and coordinated systems for continuous learning and development, all of which must be achieved while maintaining respect for personal integrity.</p>
<p>In some areas, a national division of responsibilities is needed, primarily to concentrate infrequent services that require specific skills. Within health care, a system exists today for dealing with what is known as National Specialised Medical Care, and similar working procedures may perhaps need to be developed for more areas of activities.</p>
<h2>Further development of knowledge governance</h2>
<p>When it comes to knowledge governance, our efforts will include trying to produce proposals that will contribute to ensuring that processes for obtaining knowledge bases are faster and more coordinated, and the results are more easily accessible for the user. Much is already being done within health care, and partially within the social services, but there are numbers of wishes for improvement. Processes must be speeded up, and be based more on the perspectives of the recipients. In our survey, we have seen that several agencies have overlapping tasks. Results must also be more easily accessible for the users. Apart from this, it is important to realise the limitations of knowledge governance. Complex activities can only be partially evaluated and governed using key indicators and strict guidelines.</p>
<h2>More energy needed for health-promoting and preventive work</h2>
<p>There is great consensus on the importance of disease-preventive and health-promoting methods within the health care and social services and on the need for their impact to increase. This is primarily a matter of ensuring that a preventive and health-promoting approach becomes more integrated into the daily work and knowledge development of the health care and social services. We will be focusing on this aspect in our further work. If possible, we will also present proposals on how better conditions could be created for overall health-promoting and disease-preventive work.</p>
<h2>More coordinated use of the formal policy levers</h2>
<p>Activities within the health care and social services sector meet the state in various contexts and on many different occasions. They involve supervision, regulations, permits, etc. We note that there are shortfalls in these aspects, with regard to their coordination, speed, clarity, flexibility and service. We will try to suggest a more coherent model.</p>
<h2>More developed arenas for joint development efforts</h2>
<p>Long-term, sustainable working methods are needed for broad, joint development efforts within the health care and social services in Sweden, where the state contribution could include, for example, knowledge bases, methods support, support for implementation and political proposals from the national level. The positive experiences gained from the collaboration between the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs and the Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions needs to be made use of, but the division of responsibilities should be clarified and the integration of government agencies into this work improved.</p>
<h2>The resources challenge requires a preparedness for dealing with priorities, delimitations and strategic initiatives</h2>
<p>The state needs to improve its capacity to monitor and deal with the resources challenge that it will face in the future with regard to the health care and social services. The state needs both to continually ensure that it has an overview of all the resources needed by the health care and social services, and to be able to hold a discussion on the priorities and contents of the public commitment.</p>
<h2>key issues in meeting the sector ' s challenges</h2>
<p>The changes that we have seen and that affect the health care and social services in a future perspective require a new type of management. A management for change is required that provides staff with greater skills for continuous development. Services and their staff need greater scope for innovation and initiatives. Staff also need the conditions for taking greater responsibility of their own, and for being able to make their own decisions in their day-to-day work. This is basically a responsibility of the local authorities and contry councils and the producers they engage, but the state has an important role to play, by, for example, offering a greater number of more advanced courses on management and organisation within the health care and social services. The state also needs to become better at ensuring that universities and other higher education institutions meet the general educational needs existing in the sector.</p>
<h2>The Government ' s control needs to become more long-term and strategic</h2>
<p>Today, the Government governs the health care and social services sector by frequent initiatives. Assignments to government agencies, agreements, strategies and action plans are widely used. We consider that the impact of the political priorities made at national level can increase with a more long-term approach and sustainability, and more cohesive strategic decisions. The capacity to receive assignments and other initiatives from Government is probably greatest when there is scope for planning and coordination with work initiated within government agencies, county councils and local authorities.</p>
