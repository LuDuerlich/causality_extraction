<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The information society is becoming increasingly important, and the digital revolution that began in the early 1990s effectively highlighted the potential of increased access to information held by the public sector. Access to public sector information, particularly in digital form, has high socioeconomic value and is a significant source of innovation and technological development. The Open Data Directive aims to strengthen the EU’s data economy by increasing the volume of public sector data available and improving crossborder innovation based on digital information, while also ensuring fair competition. The potential value of open data for the EU is estimated to be hundreds of billions of SEK annually.</p>
<p>While there is great value in increased access to information, particularly in the form of open data, risks to privacy and other interests worthy of protection may arise when large volumes of information are made available in digital form, providing greater opportunities for matching, processing and adding value. Such risks must be mitigated in an appropriate manner. These two perspectives have led our work on this report and the formulation of our proposal for a new open data act that implements the Open Data Directive. The potential impact of our proposals on the ability of public authorities to conduct their core activities has also been considered in our work and in drawing up the proposals summarised thematically below.</p>
<h2>A new act on open data and re-use of information</h2>
<p>We consider that a new act is the most appropriate way to implement the Open Data Directive in Swedish law. The Directive widens the range of actors covered to include public enterprises, in addition to public authorities. Another new feature is the inclusion of research data.</p>
<p>The Directive sets particular requirements in terms of format and fees for information that represents specific high-value datasets. Implementing the amendments in the current Act on the re-use of public administration documents (the PSI Act, 2010:566) which, in itself, has had limited impact, could lead to statutes that are difficult to understand and that risk continuing to have a limited effect. A new structure would make it possible to clarify the act’s purpose and scope of application, and its relationship to national provisions on access to information. Consequently, we propose the introduction of a new act – the Act on open data and re-use of information held by public authorities and public enterprises – which we call the Open Data Act throughout this report.</p>
<p>The Act implements the Open Data Directive in Swedish law and aims to increase access to public sector information, particularly in the form of open data, in order to support the development of the information market and stimulate innovation.</p>
<p>To promote the application of the Act, we propose certain amendments to the Ordinance containing instructions for the Agency for Digital Government (2018:1486).</p>
<h2>Clearer terminology</h2>
<p>Compared with the PSI Act, the Open Data Act contains a relatively large number of definitions of various terms.</p>
<p>Certain terms used in the Act – such as public enterprises , dynamic data  and specific  high-value  datasets  – originate directly from the Open Data Directive and are necessary to correctly implement the Directive, while other terms have been introduced to clarify certain important dividing lines in the Act.</p>
<p>The latter category primarily includes the terms request for  re-use, make available  and provide . The word information  is of crucial importance and is also found in the name of the Act. However, it has not been specifically defined in the Act, as such a definition would not contribute anything substantive. Rather, the word was chosen as an umbrella term instead of document , in part to avoid confusion over how the latter term is used in Chapter 2 of the Freedom of the Press Act and to avoid a situation arising whereby the Swedish Constitution could become the subject of assessment by the Court of Justice of the European Union. In our view, using the word information  contributes to an act with modern, technologyneutral and independent terminology.</p>
<h2>Boundaries to the principle of public access to official information</h2>
<p>Experience of the PSI Act shows that those applying the Act and those wanting to re-use information encounter difficulties drawing a line between the Act and the principle of public access to official information and access to official documents. Our work on this report has confirmed that reconciling the principle of public access to official information with EU regulations on re-use is far from unproblematic. For this reason, we have endeavoured to clarify these boundaries in the Open Data Act. One way is by using the word information  instead of document  to indicate that the boundaries of what is covered by the new Act are not determined by what constitutes a document under Chapter 2 of the Freedom of the Press Act.</p>
<p>Another key dividing line is the question of whether information can be made available  and, in that case, how it will be provided .</p>
<p>The question of whether certain information can be made available is not regulated by the Open Data Act but by the provisions on access found in other statutes. This dividing line follows directly from Article 1.3 of the Open Data Directive. Information is usually made available following a request for the release of official documents. Accordingly, the Act cannot be cited in support of gaining access to information. What is regulated in the Act is the provision, i.e. the format and the fees or other conditions under which the individual who made the request can have access to the information. In our assessment, specific definitions of what is meant in the new Act by making available  and providing  help to clarify where existing provisions on access cease to apply and where the new Act takes effect.</p>
<p>A request for  re-use   allows anyone requesting access to information to specify their requirements regarding how the information is to be provided. The provision stating that such a request becomes void with regard to the parts of the requested information are not made available can, in our view, further contribute to clarifying the boundary between the Open Data Act and provisions on access to information in other statutes. Accordingly, requests for re-use are not a separate way of gaining access to information to a greater extent than otherwise follows from national law.</p>
<p>Our aim in defining what is meant by a request for re-use in the new Act is not for public authorities and public enterprises to establish two parallel systems for managing requests for certain information. Rather it should be understood as a way of clarifying that the examination of any requirements concerning format, fees or other conditions stated in the request to gain access to information must be processed promptly and, if not inappropriate, by digital means. In many cases, however, these requirements will have already been met through the requirements concerning promptness and communication that follow from other statutes.</p>
<h2>Public authorities and public enterprises should make information available at their own initiative</h2>
<p>Our remit included analysing the need for legislative amendments in order, from a legal perspective, to promote public authorities’ efforts to make open data and other information available. As noted above, information is normally made available in response to a request, often pursuant to Chapter 2 of the Freedom of the Press Act. However, the Open Data Directive aims to encourage public authorities and public enterprises to make information available at their own initiative in order to promote increased re-use.</p>
<p>Although the legal system provides support for some public authorities and public enterprises to make information available voluntarily – or as part of carrying out a statutory obligation – without any prior request, clearer and broader support for such measures has been requested during the course of our work. We therefore propose introducing a provision that includes a directive encouraging public authorities and public enterprises to pursue continuous efforts to publish information at their own initiative. In our view, this type of clear legal support may help to achieve the ambition in the Government’s Digital Strategy to increase access to public sector information through better harmonisation of legal and policy objectives.</p>
<p>The PSI Act contains no corresponding provision.</p>
<p>It is important that information made available can be easily found by those wanting to re-use it. The Open Data Act therefore contains an obligation to publish a description of the information that is made available without a request and that is of particular interest for reuse. This description must be published online in a centrally accessible register, such as the Agency for Digital Government’s data portal, Sveriges dataportal .</p>
<h2>Information to be provided in certain formats</h2>
<p>In addition to the provision introduced on public authorities and public enterprises making information available at their own initiative, the Open Data Act essentially regulates the question of how  certain information will be provided. An important change compared with the PSI Act is that this Act will contain a number of obligations concerning format. These requirements will apply to both public authorities and public enterprises.</p>
<p>Information that is made available without a prior request must always be provided in accordance with the requirements stated in the Act. To prevent public authorities from performing work that is not requested, it is essential that any format requirements are asserted in some way when information is made available on request. This type of specification of a request for access constitutes a request for reuse within the meaning of the Act.</p>
<p>Format requirements are important to ensure that the best possible use is made of the value of information. Information should primarily be provided in its existing format. This means, for example, that information held at a public authority as a PDF file should be provided in this format. The aim is to minimise the work of digitising information. Furthermore, public sector actors should strive to ensure that information is provided in open and machinereadable formats to the extent that doing so has no impact on their core activities. Minimising the recipient’s need to digitise or format information in some other way is also of particular importance for dynamic data, the value of which is often linked to how up-to-date it is, as it is updated continuously, and for specific high-value datasets that in many cases contain a significant amount of information. The Act therefore contains special requirements on the digital provision of such information via an appropriate interface and for bulk downloading.</p>
<p>The format requirements in the Open Data Act implement the requirements in the Open Data Directive. For Sweden, this represents almost a paradigm shift regarding the opportunity to request that information is provided in a certain format, especially digital formats. In summary, our proposal has two important implications when information is made available on request in a specific case:</p>
<p>• The format requirements in the Act are the type of specific legal regulation referred to in the ‘transcript exception’ (utskriftsundantaget) in Chapter 2, Article 16 of the Freedom of the Press Act. Any scope for a public authority to decide that information will not be provided digitally is thus strongly restricted.</p>
<p>• If a request for information to be provided in a certain format is refused, the public authority must provide a written and reasoned decision that can be appealed.</p>
<p>A restriction of the transcript exception does not entail a restriction of the principle of public access to official information. On the contrary, our assessment is rather that it is strengthened through greater insight and transparency for the person requesting information in digital form. At the same time, privacy protection is strengthened as it is codified in a specific provision that the format requirements cannot  be applied if doing so would be inappropriate with respect to the protection of personal data.</p>
<h2>Clear regulations on fee levels that may be charged</h2>
<p>High fees may constitute an obstacle to promoting the development of new services, economic growth and social engagement through the re-use of information.</p>
<p>In order to minimise such obstacles, the Open Data Act contains provisions outlining the highest level to which fees may be calculated for different types of information and different public sector actors. Each public sector actor is responsible for ensuring its compliance with the fee levels, regardless of the legal basis for making the information available. Through a request for re-use, a user can subsequently obtain an examination of whether excessive fees were charged in a specific case. This constitutes an incentive for public authorities to charge correct fees even for information they make available at their own initiative.</p>
<p>A fee may aim to cover costs for producing, making available or providing information. The Act regulates only the fee levels and does not give public authorities or public enterprises the right to charge fees. Such a right must arise from provisions in other regulations, primarily the Fees Ordinance.</p>
<p>Although it is possible to exceed the requirements of the Directive in Swedish legislation, a balance must be maintained between the economic advantage of reduced fees and the impact this may have particularly for public authorities that are required to generate revenue to cover a substantial part of their costs. In our assessment, the Open Data Act should not exceed the levels stated in the Directive.</p>
<p>In principle, the Open Data Act applies three different fee levels: free of charge, coverage of marginal costs and full coverage of costs. In practice, coverage of marginal costs is allowed in most cases. However, fees may never be charged for research data which is covered by the new Act. Specific high-value datasets provided by public bodies other than libraries, museums or archives should also, as a main rule, be free of charge. However, certain exemptions may be granted in the Act for such information.</p>
<h2>Transparency and information on fees</h2>
<p>To enable the greatest possible re-use of information, the starting point of the Open Data Act is a restrictive use of conditions, including fees. Any conditions must be objective, proportional and nondiscriminatory. They must also be justified on grounds of public interest and must not restrict competition.</p>
<p>As a complement to these overarching principles, the Act contains special provisions aimed at preventing an exclusive right to re-use information being granted or a public authority otherwise restricting the opportunity to re-use information. An exclusive right may be granted only under certain special conditions. If such a right is granted, the arrangement must be published online before it comes into force and be subject to review at regular intervals. The requirement for prior publication of arrangements online is new in relation to the PSI Act. This will promote insight and transparency for potential re-users.</p>
<p>It follows from general principles in Swedish law that information that has been made available may also be freely re-used. Consequently, in our assessment, the provisions on exclusive rights will not lead to any major implications in practice for most actors covered by the Act.</p>
<p>To further increase transparency and predictability for users, the Open Data Act contains certain obligations for public authorities and public enterprises to publish or state the calculation basis for any fees and, if this has been pre-established, the amount of the fees. The aim is for users to know in advance the cost of providing certain information.</p>
<h2>Ways to counter increased risks associated with digital information</h2>
<p>Our remit includes considering the risks that may arise when information is provided in digital form. In our assessment, risks may arise at three different stages: in day-to-day work (i.e. when a public authority or public enterprise produces and processes certain information), when the information is made available and when it is provided.</p>
<p>The Open Data Act neither regulates nor impacts day-to-day security work or the work of protecting the privacy of individuals that public sector actors are required to carry out. However, it is important that public authorities and public enterprises continue to comply with the requirements in this respect that are set out in various regulatory frameworks.</p>
<p>Nor does the Act influence whether information may be made available on request. This is regulated exclusively by provisions on access in other statutes, primarily the Public Access to Information and Secrecy Act (2009:400). Even taking into account the fact that the provision on public authorities and public enterprises making information available at their own initiative contains a directive, it can be assumed that in doing so they will not make available information that may be subject to secrecy. Given the correct application of the relevant provisions on access, it is therefore unlikely that the Act will result in any substantial increase in risks in connection with information being made available than is currently the case. However, in order to recall relevant interests worthy of protection and, as far as possible, counter any potential risks, particularly when information is pooled, the provision on public authorities and public enterprises making information available at their own initiative is limited, meaning it cannot be applied if doing so would be inappropriate with respect to the protection of personal data or critical infrastructure, or considering Sweden’s security or information security in general.</p>
<p>Contrary to what has been stated above, the requirements we propose – that information that is made available must also be provided in certain digital formats – does entail certain risks, however, especially to privacy. For this reason, the Act states that the format requirements cannot be applied if doing so would be inappropriate with respect to the protection of personal data or if it is stated in another statute that information may not be provided in a certain format.</p>
<h2>Possibility of reviewing decisions on re-use</h2>
<p>The Open Data Act provides the possibility for users to obtain a review of how information is provided in a specific case. In order to ensure a reasonable workload for public authorities, they are required to provide a written and reasoned decision only when a request for re-use has been refused. Only these decisions can be appealed under the Open Data Act. This represents a change with respect to the PSI Act, which instead links the right to a review with someone submitting a special request for a decision. In our view, the proposed arrangement strikes a balance between the increased workload for public authorities and the right to a review in an appropriate, predictable and effective way.</p>
<h2>Impact</h2>
<p>Our overall assessment is that the Act will promote greater access to information for re-use, particularly in formats that facilitate pro- cessing and adding value. This can be expected to lead to positive socio-economic effects.</p>
<p>The Open Data Act is not expected to result in any increase in costs for actors other than for those covered by its scope of appli- cation or for those wanting to re-use information. For most public authorities and public enterprises covered by the Act, it will be possible to accommodate the financial impact resulting from the proposals within existing appropriations.</p>
<p>For actors currently financing a major part of their activities through fees, the regulation of specific high-value datasets may have a significant financial impact by reducing revenues for such infor- mation. This loss of revenue may be covered in part through the redistribution of funds between public authorities. The remaining loss of revenue should be covered through increased appropriations for certain public authorities. Further investigation and follow-up are required concerning which actors will lose revenue and which will have reduced expenditures.</p>
<p>The proposals on capping fee levels and banning arrangements providing exclusive rights represent restrictions to local self-govern- ment. However, these restrictions are required to implement the Open Data Directive and are considered to have a relatively marginal effect in practice.</p>
<p>The Agency for Digital Government will receive an expanded mandate as the Agency will promote the application of the Act. An appropriation increase is likely necessary to fully carry out this mandate.</p>
