<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>In the last 100 years, Sweden has gone from being one of Europe’s poorer countries, with a high level of emigration, to becoming one of the most prosperous and innovative and with a relatively high level of immigration. The driving forces behind this development have included innovation and constant renewal. In order to maintain our pole position, therefore, we must ensure that we constantly implement change not previously implemented by any other country. We need to be more innovative than anyone else. The education and research at Swedish higher education institutions are an essential part of that work.</p>
<p>If such institutions are to play the important role in sustainable development that society has the right to expect, the right conditions need to be in place to enable them to make a greater contribution to new solutions that lead to increased competitiveness, reduced environmental impact and new jobs. The extent to which students, researchers and other colleagues at higher education institutions are able to achieve this varies a great deal. At some institutions, innovation support and the institutions’ holding companies function well, while at other institutions, support is non-existent.</p>
<p>In order for us to maintain our leading position as a country of innovation, it is therefore important that we improve support for the utilisation of research results and other knowledge acquired at higher education institutions and that this is available across the country. A key piece of the puzzle is the attitude of students and employees towards the utilisation of results. A higher education institution that works extensively on influencing attitudes and education in entrepreneurship will also be able to demonstrate increased implementation of its research in the community.</p>
<p>In summary, the inquiry’s remit has been to analyse various aspects of innovation support available to the higher education institutions and to make proposals for ways to improve that support.</p>
<h2>Innovation support at Sweden’s higher education institutions is fragmented</h2>
<p>The Higher Education Act (1992:1434) states that the role of higher education institutions includes working in partnership with the community around them, keeping it informed about their work and ensuring that their research results benefit society. Higher education institutions play an important role in the utilisation of researchbased knowledge and are thus a vital part of the innovation system. The higher education institutions’ parts of the system include innovation offices and holding companies.</p>
<p>Innovation offices are closest to the innovators</p>
<p>The innovation offices (also known as Technology Transfer Offices) came about as a result of proposals in the Government’s 2008 and 2012 research policy bills. When the offices were established, certain resources were provided, and higher education institutions with innovation offices have subsequently received annual state funding of approximately SEK 107 million (2020) to support their work. The organisation, location and working methods of the innovation offices may vary, but one aspect that they have in common is that they work within the higher education institution to capture and develop ideas from employees and, in some cases, also from students. An important part of the innovation offices’ work is to disseminate information about their own activities and to promote a more positive attitude towards the utilisation of research and knowledge.</p>
<p>There are currently 13 innovation offices, which means that most of the higher education institutions in Sweden do not have their own innovation office. In several cases, the institutions that do not have their own innovation offices are expected to be able to use the innovation offices of other nearby institutions. Several of the institutions without their own innovation office stated during the inquiry that it can be difficult to get sufficient access to the services the offices offer.</p>
<p>Several of the holding companies operate as state-owned venture capital companies</p>
<p>Holding companies at higher education institutions are wholly stateowned companies that are managed by the institutions. The companies own, manage and sell shares in wholly or jointly owned companies whose remit is to undertake research and development activities for commercialisation. The holding companies help to commercialise research results and ideas and operate at an earlier stage of investment than other funding providers. In addition, the companies also provide commissioned training, sell consulting services and in some cases own infrastructure.</p>
<p>The first holding companies were established in 1994 and 1995 with the aim of promoting commercialisation and collaboration with the business community and other players. There are now 18 companies at the same number of state higher education institutions. Most companies benefited from a capital injection at the point of set-up, and over the years additional capital has been introduced into the companies.</p>
<p>The higher education institutions work closely with the wider innovation system</p>
<p>Sweden’s public innovation system comprises a number of different players. In addition to those at or close to the higher education institutions, there are also research institutes, incubators and technology parks. The areas of responsibility of the various players sometimes overlap and can vary greatly from region to region. In health care, the overlap can be particularly challenging, especially when an innovator has a role that is split between academia and the region.</p>
<h2>There are major shortcomings in the appropriateness and effectiveness of the support</h2>
<p>The terms of reference of the inquiry included an analysis of whether the current system of holding companies and innovation offices was appropriate and effective. According to the inquiry’s analysis, there are major shortcomings in both the appropriateness of the support (are the right things being done?) and its effectiveness (are things being done the right way?).</p>
<p>Inadequate monitoring and evaluation of the innovation offices’ activity</p>
<p>The inquiry believes that the major variations between the country’s higher education institutions in terms of their access to support and work on utilisation means that the support is not appropriate. There are currently institutions that have almost no access to professional support for their students, researchers or other staff.</p>
<p>A key observation made by the inquiry is the lack of monitoring and evaluation of the institutions’ work on utilisation. The information that is available about the innovation offices reveals major differences in terms of the flow of ideas from the institutions’ activities. The effectiveness of the innovation offices thus varies.</p>
<p>Three of the holding companies have the lion’s share of investment</p>
<p>The holding companies and their investment activity are easier to monitor. Here, too, there are big differences. The holding companies at Gothenburg University, Lund University and Uppsala University together account for approximately 70 per cent of the investments made by the holding companies in the past five years. If these holding companies are omitted from the statistics, the rate of investment is more modest, in terms of both sums of money and number of investments. The inquiry therefore feels that access to finance is deficient and uneven across the country. Other public players, such as Almi Företagspartner AB and Almi Invest AB, have not compensated for this, as it has not been part of their remit. In the inquiry’s opinion, the result is a consequence of a long-standing policy – the holding companies have been given a task but not the funds needed to wholly fulfil their remits.</p>
<p>Management of the holding companies has been deficient</p>
<p>In March 2020, the Swedish National Audit Office published a review of the governance and management of the holding companies. According to the review, the Government’s governance of the higher education institutions has not properly equipped the institutions to manage the holding companies. Deficiencies in governance include monitoring and communication with the institutions and the holding companies and reporting to the Riksdag (Swedish Parliament). Few of the institutions monitor their commissioned training contracts with the holding companies, and several company boards have no goals or strategies to guide their activity. The inquiry broadly agrees with the Swedish National Audit Office’s analysis and proposes a number of measures to develop governance of the holding companies and the companies’ activity.</p>
<p>The greatest risk of overlap is in health care</p>
<p>One question addressed by the inquiry is whether there is a risk of overlap between the higher education institutions and other innovation support. The inquiry believes that the greatest risk of this is in health care, where a person may have a role that is split between academia and the region.</p>
<p>The inquiry also looked at RISE (Research Institutes of Sweden) and the work it does on commercialising research results. The inquiry is of the opinion that its activities do not overlap with the work of innovation offices or holding companies.</p>
<p>There are challenges with state aid as soon as an idea is translated into a commercial enterprise</p>
<p>As part of its work, the inquiry also looked at the relationship between higher education institution-based support for utilisation and the regulations for state aid. The inquiry believes that the support provided by the innovation offices does not present a clear risk of unauthorised state aid. The holding companies’ work involves investment in companies. Here too, nothing has emerged during the inquiry that clearly indicates that, in undertaking this activity, the holding companies provide support in ways that are incompatible with the state aid regulations.</p>
<p>The inquiry did not look at the activities of other forms of innovation support (such as technology parks and incubators) in connection with state aid.</p>
<p>All activities include both financial and other transactions that are affected by the state aid regulations, and many agreements are entered into that touch on state aid issues in various ways. One question often considered is whether support provided is given to a party that is not currently running a business but may do so in the future. Questions often arise relating to the management and transfer of intellectual property rights. Overall, the inquiry therefore feels that there is a need for increased guidance and governance in relation to the state aid regulations within the higher education institutionbased innovation support system. It is proposed that this be part of the remit of Vinnova (the Swedish agency for innovation systems), through a new financing company (Finansieringsbolaget) and as part of the skills development remit of the Swedish Patent and Registration Office.</p>
<h2>The inquiry proposes increased support for innovation and the establishment of various support functions</h2>
<p>The inquiry proposes a number of measures to remedy the shortcomings in the appropriateness and effectiveness cy of the current support. The starting point is a broader definition of utilisation which requires the higher education institutions to ensure that not only research results but also other knowledge acquired at the institutions benefits society.</p>
<p>Simply stated, the proposals divide into proposals for innovationpromoting activities, proposals for the funding of ‘project companies’ (start-up companies deriving from the institutions of higher education) and proposals for increased governance of and freedom for the holding companies. In addition, the inquiry proposes a number of functions to support the higher education institutions’ work on utilisation and contribute to increased learning.</p>
<p>The activity must be monitored and evaluated</p>
<p>As stated above, there has historically been a lack of ongoing monitoring and evaluation of the higher education institutions’ work on utilisation. To address this, the inquiry proposes that monitoring be included in the annual monitoring programme run by the Swedish Higher Education Authority, with an evaluation every four years. The evaluation will be based on a model involving eight different indicators and will be undertaken by Vinnova. It will help to ensure that the results and impact of the higher education institutions’ activities are reported. The results of the work on utilisation are to be reported in the Research Bill, and this will enable the Riksdag to assess the extent to which objectives are being met within this policy area.</p>
<p>Those institutions whose work to support utilisation is deemed successful can be allocated an innovation office by the Government following a proposal from Vinnova.</p>
<p>Joining forces via thematic innovation offices</p>
<p>The inquiry concludes that there appears to be a need in some areas for greater provision of innovation support than is currently available. In light of this, it is proposed that the Government be able to allocate enhanced innovation office assignments to at least two higher education institutions working in partnership. These offices should have a special thematic focus and might include a special innovation office for life sciences.</p>
<p>Increased appropriations for innovation offices and for verification</p>
<p>Higher education institutions that qualify for an innovation office receive a government appropriation of SEK 5–20 million. The amount of the appropriation depends on the size of the institution. The thematic innovation offices can be awarded additional funding of at least SEK25 million per year.</p>
<p>One observation made by the inquiry is that some ideas, especially those that are scientifically complex, are incorporated at a relatively early stage. This is partly because the higher education institutions and their students, researchers and other staff do not have the resources to develop the idea further. Once it is incorporated, other support functions and capital are then available to support development. Several higher education institutions’ innovation offices say that this often means that the idea never reaches the market because they are not close enough to it. To remedy this, the inquiry proposes additional funding for evaluation of commercial potential (VFT programme) of SEK 100 million per year.</p>
<p>A variety of support functions that contribute to learning</p>
<p>To ensure increased learning at the higher education institutions amongst students, researchers and other employees, the inquiry proposes various measures to assist with more strategic work on intellectual property rights. The Swedish Patent and Registration Office and the Swedish Agency for Government Employers will both seek to promote learning in this area and to ensure intellectual property rights get greater protection. All higher education institutions should be tasked with developing an intellectual property strategy.</p>
<p>The inquiry believes that learning is key at all levels, not least in the case of entrepreneurship. To develop shared learning between higher education institutions and to enhance the availability of expertise around entrepreneurship, the inquiry proposes the establishment of a national centre for entrepreneurship. The centre will be financed through appropriations of SEK 20 million per year.</p>
<p>Research councils should play a more active role in utilisation proposes that research councils and state research foundations put various measures in place to influence attitudes to utilisation and help raise awareness of various barriers, ensuring action is taken to overcome them.</p>
<h2>Holding companies as an enhanced tool for utilisation</h2>
<p>As noted above, monitoring and management of the holding companies has previously been deficient. To address this, and to ensure that all higher education institutions can have a holding company of their own, the inquiry proposes a number of measures. The proposals mean that the holding companies will have a public service obligation and the higher education institutions will be able to make freer use of them. There will also be additional reporting requirements. The inquiry’s proposal also means that individual holding companies may not undertake investment in project companies to develop students’, researchers’ or other employees’ ideas. Instead, investment activity will be broadened to include more financing products and also centralised, so that there is greater equality of access to funding across the country. It is proposed that a joint financing company (Finansieringsbolaget) be established for this purpose, which will also provide a number of shared support functions.</p>
<p>Each higher education institution will be able to have its own holding company and be authorised to deploy funds for utilisation</p>
<p>Currently, a higher education institution cannot establish a holding company without a Government decision. The inquiry proposes that each higher education institution be allowed to form a holding company if they so wish and that they also be given the opportunity to transfer funds to the company, with some restrictions.</p>
<p>The inquiry’s proposals will enable the holding companies’ activities to be broadened. The current regulatory framework already allows them to provide commissioned training (Karlstad University’s holding company is a good example of this). The inquiry’s proposals mean that the holding companies will have access to larger amounts of money and will be more able to represent the higher education institution as a legal entity when entering into agreements with third parties than is currently the case. The holding companies will be able to be used more extensively to meet various training needs, to sell services and take other actions to utilise results from research activities on a commercial basis.</p>
<p>To address shortcomings in procedures for feedback and risk capital, the inquiry proposes a jointly owned limited company</p>
<p>While reviewing Sweden’s holding companies, it emerged that there was a need for improvement in several areas. The needs include developing a uniform basis for reporting and monitoring, handling of state aid rules, and intellectual property issues, and reducing risks in the context of the holding companies’ ‘venture capital activity’. The inquiry feels that both higher education institutions and holding companies vary considerably in their ability to meet these needs. Considering this, the inquiry proposes that higher education institutions with holding companies be commissioned to form a consortium to manage a joint limited company (Finansieringsbolaget). Joint management will be regulated by a shareholder agreement whereby the more important components will be determined by the Government.</p>
<p>The joint Finansieringsbolaget will ensure that Sweden’s project companies are offered a wide range of products throughout the country</p>
<p>Only a handful of the 18 holding companies active at Swedish higher education institutions today invest in project companies that have arisen as a result of the institutions’ activities. The inquiry’s synthesis of investment flows shows that most investments are made by the holding companies at Gothenburg University, Lund University and Uppsala University. The analysis carried out by the inquiry shows that investment activity can be improved in terms of equality of access to funding across the country and broadened in terms of the financing products offered.</p>
<p>The inquiry’s proposals mean that the holding companies will be retained, but there will be a shareholder agreement between the companies that will involve the establishment of a joint group company, Finansieringsbolaget. Financing decisions will be made by</p>
<p>Finansieringsbolaget, and thus no decisions will be made by the holding companies in respect of the project companies. In addition, Finansieringsbolaget will offer a mix of different financing solutions, including soft loans and convertibles. The new company, like the holding companies, will be a state-owned company. Feedback will be provided in the form of annual follow-up included in Finansieringsbolaget’s annual report, and the company’s activity will also be included in the four-yearly evaluation of the higher education institutions’ work on utilisation. Finansieringsbolaget will provide a forum for the holding companies to engage in dialogue with the Government Offices of Sweden and other important stakeholders, and will produce joint reports and data for Vinnova and other players.</p>
<h2>The inquiry’s proposals create structures for more innovative higher education institutions</h2>
<p>The inquiry’s impact assessment shows that the proposals will entail new working methods for higher education institutions and their associated innovation offices, for holding companies and for various government agencies. The inquiry’s proposals will give the higher education institutions increased freedoms with regard to the holding companies and their role. The proposals for innovation offices and verification funds also mean that, as public authorities, the higher education institutions will be allocated increased resources to work on utilisation. This in turn is expected to help ensure more solutions are implemented, as well as ensure greater sustainability and compet- itiveness, and should also lead to more employment opportunities. The inquiry’s four-step implementation model involves more moni- toring and evaluation, which is expected in turn to contribute to learning and, in the long run, to improved support for utilisation at Sweden’s higher education institutions.</p>
<p>For the Government and the Riksdag, the proposals mean in- creased transparency and a significantly improved basis for gover- nance. With Finansieringsbolaget – the financing company jointly owned by the holding companies – in place, there will be uniform reporting for all holding companies and financing capital (warrants, loans or risk capital) will be handled in the same way throughout the country. With a single player handling increased volumes, manage- ment of central government assets will be professionalised. Having</p>
<p>one coordinating body also means that other organisations within the innovation system will find contact with the project companies at Swedish higher education institutions easier.</p>
<p>The overall cost of the proposals is SEK 340 million per year: SEK 100 million for increased VFT support, SEK 30 million for fi- nancing instruments (Finansieringsbolaget) and an increase of SEK 168 million for the activity of the innovation offices when they achieve their full capacity. There will be additional costs for estab- lishing and running the financing company (SEK 10 million per year), Vinnova’s grants and evaluation of innovation office activity (SEK 5 million per year) and the Swedish Patent and Registration Office’s remit to deliver intellectual property support to the higher education institutions (SEK 5 million per year). The establishment of a new national centre for entrepreneurship is expected to require SEK 20 million per year. The impact assessment at Chapter 10 of the report sets out the inquiry’s proposals for how the appropriations can be redistributed.</p>
