<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>The need for a debate on gender equality and IT</h2>
<p>The sub-report from Jämit, the Gender Equality Council for Transport and IT (Jämställdhetsrådet för transporter och IT – Jämit), is concerned with demonstrating that as a technology IT is a male domain, although its applications meet the needs of women just as much as the needs of men. That power is sustained in that male interpretations on issues relating to the development and application of IT take precedence. That power may be sustained in different ways, because of language, because the way in which women approach technology is attributed low value, because women reject technology and because men exclude women through de facto quotas. That this is the case is proved by the fact that technology-based education and the IT industry remain heavily male-dominated. The point is therefore to have the will to change existing patterns and to identify the means for such change.</p>
<p>Jämit´s objective is that women and men together must steer the development of IT.</p>
<h2>IT and gender equality</h2>
<p>Information technology (IT) is generally perceived as a collective term covering such diverse technologies as telephony, mobile telephony, radio, television, fax, data communications via e-mail and the Internet, data processing systems and electronic invoicing systems. In the past 5–10 years, technological advances have also created the conditions for convergence of these formerly separate technological systems. No-one today is surprised that a PC can be used as a telephone or a television as a computer. But the system is also one in which form of ownership, organization and system of regulation determine how it develops.</p>
<p>Both gender equality and equality are terms that pertain to imbalances between people, arising from power, influence, income etc. Equality is concerned with social and economic justice between people and groups. Gender equality is concerned with justice between the genders.</p>
<p>At the 1995 UN:s Women’s Conference, held in Peking, Sweden was named as the world:s leading country for gender equality. In its final report Ty makten är din… (”For the power is yours...”) (SOU 1998:6), Kvinnomaktutredningen (Study of the Distribution of Economic Power and Economic Resources between Women and Men) declared that this was a flattering and presumably correct judgement but, if it was, this was merely because the situation was much worse in most other parts of the world. Sweden is not a country of gender equality. According to Jämit, the development of IT has not made things better. As a result, the need for both women and men to participate in the development of IT is a matter of urgent concern.</p>
<h2>Women and men in IT</h2>
<p>The Jämit project established that the IT sector is, in all essential respects, led and dominated by men, and that the gap between the opportunities for women and men for influence on the development of IT is widening.</p>
<p>The percentage of women in certain IT sectors is low, and there are few women in leading positions in stock market quoted IT companies.</p>
<p>Women are generally more highly educated and trained than men. 15 % of all those in gainful employment in 1997 were women with post secondary education and training, compared to 13 % men.</p>
<p>There are few women with a high level of education and training in the IT sector. Of all people in gainful employment in certain IT sectors in 1997, 48 % were men with post secondary education and training, while just 14 % were women. 95 % of employees in the child-care sector are women. At compulsory comprehensive school, nearly 75 % of teachers are women. At upper secondary school, the male/ female ratio is relatively equal, although the percentage of male teachers is slightly higher.</p>
<p>The boy/girl ratio in the two biggest upper secondary school programmes – social sciences and natural sciences – indicates that boys and girls make their choice along traditional lines. Only 16 % of pupils on the technology side are girls.</p>
<p>More women than men have graduate qualifications. Around 60 % of all students taking degree examinations in 1998 were women.</p>
<p>More men than women have qualifications in EDP and applied system sciences. In addition, the proportion of women declined slightly between academic year 1991/92 and academic year 1998/99 – from 46 % to 34 %.</p>
<p>More men than women graduate in engineering/ IT. The proportion of women graduating as engineers with a specialization in IT has hovered at 5–11% between academic year 1989/90, inclusive, and academic year 1998/99, inclusive.</p>
<p>More men than women are engaged in research. In autumn 1998, 41 % of active research students were women. The percentage of women in the recently approved technological research courses in 1998 was 26 %.</p>
<h2>Old structures must be changed</h2>
<p>Society is controlled by both visible and invisible structures. These are cultural, technical, organizational, economic, social and legal structures, all of which in one way or another contribute towards maintaining a society of gender inequality.</p>
<p>To be able to change old patterns, we have to expose how various structures are manifested in our day-to-day lives, in school and at work. One of the most important means of revealing structures and norms that maintain unequal conditions, is for both men and women to be given access to all sectors of society and to be represented at all levels. Statistics are another means of revealing structures.</p>
<h2>Dare to talk about power!</h2>
<p>To fundamentally change a society of gender inequality, it is necessary to question the whole of the pattern that we are all helping to sustain. That is the size and difficulty of the task. What we need to do is start a debate on what the issue actually is, when we talk about the distribution of power between the genders.</p>
<h2>”Take gender out of technology…”</h2>
<p>Technology is a male-dominated area. This implicit, fundamental value judgement has up to today decided how technology develops, and still rules.</p>
<p>In his book Män och deras maskiner (Men and their machines), Ulf Mellström writes about the culturally and symbolically strong link that exists between men and machines. It is because men have this symbolic power over technology that they also have the power to define what technology is, writes Mellström.</p>
<p>Lena Sommestad´s dissertation Från mejerska till mejerist (From dairymaid to dairy technician), also illustrates the symbolic power of technology. Here, the point is illustrated by a development in the opposite direction, namely when the dairy process evolved from being a typical women’s occupation into a male-dominated one. It was the introduction of new technology that not only brought a rise in status of the profession but also made possible the link to men and masculinity.</p>
<p>Historically, the institutes of technology have been male domains. In the book Sakernas tillstånd, kön, klass, teknisk expertis (The state of things, gender, class, technological expertise), Boel Berner writes about the historical and social circumstances in which the institutes of technology evolved, and how gender and class came into play. Education in engineering was for men. Not until 1921 were women allowed admission into engineering courses at the Royal Institute of Technology Stockholm on the same formal conditions as for men.</p>
<p>Because men hold the symbolic power over technology, they also have the power to define what technology is. This is evident to differing degrees in IT education, too. It may be evident in the nature and content of a course, in the right to define what is an elegant program, in a correct way of working or in being a good programmer. In an environment of this kind, many women gradually fall silent or are quietened.</p>
<p>Language may exclude women. The environment of the IT world often embraces a language and an open sexism that many women find offensive and stressful.</p>
<p>A low valuation of their worth may keep women away from technology subjects. It is the way the boys approach technology that shows through in the way it is taught; the approach of girls is if anything ridiculed.</p>
<p>Jämit concludes that the choice of technology by girls at schools coincides with the point in their life when girls mature and become young women. At that time, it is expected by school and society that girls – at that very point in time – will choose by desire and inspiration an education which by its entire nature, form and language communicates that this is for men, it is no place for women.</p>
<h2>The differing everyday lives of women and men</h2>
<p>A report from the Swedish National Board of Housing, Building and Planning Hela Samhället (The Whole of Society) (1996) reported on aspects of gender equality in physical planning and the built environment. The report contains summaries and analyses of similarities and differences between men and women in connection with land use and the built environment. Issues such as travel patterns, working life, care and consumer habits are dealt with. The report highlights the differing everyday lives of men and women, the fact that women and men have different needs and different dreams, and that they have different priorities. As a result, women and men have different experiences and also have different knowledge to contribute to a planning process. The reality of women is not the reality of men.</p>
<p>Jämit concludes that a precondition for a society gender equality is that both women and men should be included, and should have an influence, in all areas and at all levels.</p>
<h2>Ways to achieve change</h2>
<p>What is necessary is for women and men together to set aside antiquated standards, structures, working methods and organizations, and to find ways to relate to each other and technology, that are characterized by gender equality. This implies: defining clearly the ways men and women approach technology defining clearly what motivates men and what motivates women in data technology enabling women´s knowledge, attitudes and values to be expressed in different ways when it comes to developing new technology creating a situation in which all levels of society place a higher value on women´s way of approaching technology providing women with the opportunity to change their attitude to data technology via their own experiences and female role models; the efforts being made in many areas, affecting education and business, should be placed at a premium and emphasized.</p>
<h2>Quality of life in a sustainable IT society</h2>
<p>Through the growth in the Internet, e-mail and mobile telephony, IT has made it possible for people to reach one another all over the world at all times of the day. Technology itself can help to change the way we choose our homes and travel in the future. Teleworking may become increasingly common, and travel to work may become more and more adapted to individual requirements. In other words, technology may help increase individual freedom and develop a spirit of community between people.</p>
<p>On the other hand … technological development may contribute to increased isolation and solitude. The rapid development of IT has its disadvantages, temporary or long lasting, and these must also be considered in the debate.</p>
<p>Increased vulnerability. Older people today are more vulnerable than young people, as a result of the speed of technological development. The official report När åsikter blir handling (When opinions become action) (SOU 1998:16) into attitudes in the social insurance system reveals the women encounter less favourable conditions and are less well treated than men. If the contacts between public authorities and sick and unemployed claimants are now replaced by communication via the Internet instead of inperson meetings, the already vulnerable will become even more at risk.</p>
<p>Higher levels of stress. The development of IT has led to the creation of a new work culture. Managers and employees are now expected to be constantly available for all information, whether via telephone, e-mail or fax, and for physical meetings. Work and private life are flowing together. Being ”burned out” now seems to be an ”accepted state of ill-health”, and the number of people on long-term sick leave has risen drastically over recent year, even among young people. For different reasons, women are most vulnerable. Women still have the greatest responsibility for children and the family, and are the ones who find it most difficult to combine this with intense pressure at work.</p>
<p>Increased anonymity. The possible ways in which certain persons can remain anonymous on the Internet may represent a threat to other people. People can use any name they like and any identity they like, and thus conceal their purpose. Using false names, paedophiles can make contact with young girls via the Internet. Other threats are higher risks of exposure, for example, to games depicting violence, as well as to pornography and racist propaganda, as the content carried on the Internet expands.</p>
<p>Widening gaps between the poor and the rich. In most poor countries, gender equality basically does not exist. In countries where illiteracy is widespread, the rich will be able to use information technology to maintain their own power. Obviously, those who have no school education cannot use any form of information technology, which for the time being still presupposes knowledge of the written language. This demonstrates how important it is for the government, when providing aid to other countries, also to take account of gender equality issues in decisions relating to IT projects.</p>
<p>The development of IT is an gender equality issue. It has to be analyzed, the consequences of the political objectives must be described and indicators relating to a sustainable IT society must be developed. According to Jämit, the government must take on a forcing role in bringing about an analysis of the development of IT from an gender equality perspective. Jämit also concludes that the government must take on a forcing role in ensuring that the decisions of public authorities also reflect the results of that analysis.</p>
<h2>Jämit´s recommendations</h2>
<p>(Ch. 3.6.2) – Development of statistics</p>
<p>Jämit recommends that the government should commission the public authorities concerned to develop statistics on aspects of IT from the viewpoint of gender equality .</p>
<p>(Ch. 3.6.3) – Goals and management of objectives – gender equality ant IT</p>
<p>The government should require all public authorities in their annual reporting to document and report on the consequences in terms of gender equality from increased use of IT. This reporting should describe the consequences both within the authority concerned and in the area of society in which the authority operates. On that basis, the government can then carry out analyses and propose measures.</p>
<p>(Ch. 3.6.4) – Gender equality and IT in overseas aid</p>
<p>The government should take the initiative in establishing a link between the issue of IT and the issue of gender equality in overseas aid policy, and in ensuring that the IT issue is also dealt with from an gender equality perspective in the work of overseas aid.</p>
<p>(Ch. 3.6.5) – Gender equality, IT and the European Union</p>
<p>Jämit recommends that the government, in preparing for all ministerial conferences during its Presidency, should allow scope for the inclusion of the development of IT, and its implications in connection with gender equality. Both these issues affect all sectors of society. It is important that work in developing IT should take issues of gender equality into account.</p>
<p>(Ch.6.2.4) – Dismantling of current informal de facto  quota practice in the appointment of men to the boards of companies</p>
<p>The government should immediately initiate a review of the legislation in order to increase the participation by women in the boards of companies.</p>
<p>(Ch. 7.5.1) – Change of approach in education</p>
<p>The educational approach at all levels from compulsory comprehensive school to university and institute of technology should be changed so that it is generally based on a philosophy of gender equality.</p>
<p>The government should initiate an evaluation of teaching materials from the point of view of gender.</p>
<p>Aspects of genderand technology-related issues should form part of all teacher training and of IT- and other technology-based education.</p>
<p>In examination objectives for all teacher training courses, the government should stipulate that these should emanate from, and should promote, aspects of gender equality.</p>
<p>The National Agency for Higher Education, in particular the Council for the Renewal of Higher Education, should be required to promote gender/ technology issues in teacher training.</p>
<p>The National Agency for Education should be required to promote gender/ technology issues in teacher training.</p>
<p>(Ch. 7.5.2) – Research councils and the new research supervisory authority</p>
<p>Jämit recommends that the government, on receiving the Commission’s report on 31 March, 2001, should pay particular attention to how the government’s requirement of equal gender allocation has been observed.</p>
<p>Jämit recommends that in its control documents, including instructions and directives, the government should clearly indicate the extent and manner of observance of gender equality considerations within each area of research, and that the government should require these issues to be followed up.</p>
