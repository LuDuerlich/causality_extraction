<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Background and introduction</h2>
<p>The Inquiry’s main task has been to propose a statutory regulation for cases that, under the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (European Convention), require the possibility of awarding damages to a person affected by a violation of the Convention. Our remit is to be viewed in light of recent developments in case law.</p>
<p>In a number of decisions, the Supreme Court has noted that, under the regulations of the Tort Liability Act concerning state liability, Sweden does not completely meet its commitments under the European Convention (see, for example, NJA 2005 p. 462). This is particularly true concerning the possibilities of obtaining compensation for non-pecuniary damage. The decisions mean that the right to compensation for non-pecuniary damage is broadened in cases where it has been established that error or negligence incurring liability on the part of public authorities (i.e. a state or municipality) also entails a violation of the European Convention.</p>
<p>The statutory regulation currently referred to should be analysed from the perspectives of both civil law (in terms of tort liability) and international law (in terms of the Convention). First and foremost, it is necessary to conduct a review of current Swedish legislation concerning non-contractual liability, primarily regulation of liability of public authorities. Second, Sweden’s commitments in terms of the Convention must be clarified in more detail. This is particularly relevant regarding the right to an effective remedy stated in Article 13 of the Convention, including the obligation to pay financial compensation if a violation of the Convention occurs. These issues are addressed in the first two chapters of the report (following the introductory chapter on our remit).</p>
<p>Chapter 2 contains an account of the regulations in the Tort Liability Act and the general legal principles upon which the Act is based. Focus has been placed on the provisions concerning liability of public authorities in the event of error or negligence while exercising pubic authority and the applicable special jurisdictional rules, etc. for bringing an action against the state for damages in such cases (Chapter 3, Tort Liability Act). Some of the special legislation that regulates liability of the state and the municipalities is also of certain interest, as is other legislation that imposes liability on both public authorities and individuals under certain conditions. Particular attention is given to rules on non-pecuniary damage. The chapter concludes with a description of the legal developments mentioned above, through which the opportunities of obtaining compensation for non-pecuniary damage have been broadened as a result of Sweden’s obligations under the Convention. The legal cases highlight shortcomings in the current regulatory system and the need of a statutory regulation concerning liability of public authorities for violations of the European Convention.</p>
<p>Chapter 3 contains an account of the European Convention and case law from the European Court of Human Rights (European Court), primarily regarding the right to an effective remedy stated in Article 13. The reason is that this Article of the Convention has the greatest significance on the design of a national damages regulation aimed at fulfilling Sweden’s commitments under the Convention.</p>
<p>In brief, Article 13 means that a person who can reasonably claim to have been subjected to a violation of the Convention is to have the opportunity to have his or her claim examined by a national authority and to obtain redress or just satisfaction for established violations. The legal remedy must be accessible and feasible for the person concerned to use, and offer genuine opportunities for examination of the issue in question. In addition, the legal remedy must be intended to lead to redress and provide reasonable prospects of success, even if this does not necessarily lead to success for the complainant. Finally, the examination must lead to a decision within a reasonable period of time and it must be possible to enforce the judgment or decision. However, Article 13 does not provide for a general right to damages.</p>
<p>Also of importance are the articles in the European Convention relating to the conditions under which an application may be examined by the European Court (Articles 34 and 35) and the</p>
<p>Court’s powers to award damages when a violation of the Convention is established under the provision on just satisfaction in Article 41. The same also applies to the obligation of the Contracting States to abide by the Court’s judgments in cases to which they are parties (Article 46), and in general to ensure that everyone in their jurisdiction enjoys the rights and freedoms defined in the Convention (Article 1, which expresses the principles of loyalty and subsidiarity ). A brief description of these Articles is therefore provided. An introductory section also discusses general issues concerning the Convention and its structure, familiarity with which is important in order to understand the description as a whole.</p>
<p>Since Article 13 does not primarily regulate issues concerning the obligation of states to provide damage penalties if a violation of the Convention occurs – but instead deals with remedies in a broader sense – we have not considered it necessary to supplement the report with an account of Swedish law in one respect. This is with regard to the question of which domestic remedy of a procedural and material nature could comply with the requirements in the European Convention. Chapter 4 gives examples of remedies available in Swedish law for examining alleged violations of the Convention and providing just satisfaction when violations are established. In addition, some examples are given of Swedish “legal remedies” that have been rejected by the European Court.</p>
<p>Under the terms of reference, our work is also to include reasonable international comparisons. A more extensive comparative study is of particular importance to the purpose of the inquiry. This is because the states bound by the European Convention and which have submitted to the jurisdiction of the European Court have, in principle, the same commitments as Sweden when it comes to the issues we will analyse. We have chosen to gather information about the legal situation in twelve Council of Europe member states. The results are presented in Chapter 5.</p>
<h2>The need for and potential of using legislation to regulate the right to damages in the event of violations of the European Convention</h2>
<p>Our considerations are presented in Chapter 6 of the report. The introductory sections (Sections 6.1–6.3) contain an assessment of the need for legislation on damages for violations of the European</p>
<p>Convention, and what could comprise the fundamental conditions for a statutory regulation of this kind.</p>
<p>To begin with, it is noted that as a Contracting State, Sweden is obliged to guarantee the human rights covered by the European Convention and its Additional Protocols, and to provide remedies for examining any violations of these rights (Articles 1 and 13 of the Convention). It is also noted that effective remedies at national level are an important tool for guaranteeing that individuals can enjoy their human rights as defined in the Convention. The creation of such remedies emphasises that the primary responsibility of the Contracting States is to protect the human rights of individuals in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity  (see also above). Another important aspect is that the establishment of effective domestic remedies – including the possibility of obtaining financial compensation when violations are established – should reduce the incentive for individuals to lodge complaints with the European Court. This would lead to better prospects for the Court to work efficiently.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the biggest problem in Swedish law from the perspective of the Convention used to be the limited opportunities to obtain compensation for non-pecuniary damage in the event of error or negligence while exercising public authority that also includes a violation of the European Convention. Even if the right to compensation for non-pecuniary damage regarding violations of the Convention has been expanded through recent case law, our conclusion is that it is necessary to clarify the legal situation concerning restorative remedies in case of such violations. At the same time, we have found that the Swedish view regarding compensation for non-pecuniary damage can be compatible with the Convention and that it does not prevent a statutory regulation in this area.</p>
<p>As we understand our remit, the starting point for a damages regulation should be to view damages as one of several remedies. Financial compensation should thus not be the remedy to be considered first. This means that as far as possible, violations should primarily be redressed or remedied within the framework of the process in which they arise. For this to be possible, courts and administrative authorities must be aware of issues that concern the European Convention in both procedural and material terms. At the same time, individuals cannot remain passive in their contacts with courts and authorities. A view that includes requirements of this kind is also compatible with the Convention.</p>
<p>As previously indicated, in terms of the Convention, Article 13 on the right to an effective remedy forms the basis of introducing a damages penalty. At the same time, it should be emphasised that the Contracting States have great freedom to choose the way in which they fulfil their commitments in this regard. The report examines various alternatives for a damages regulation for violations of the Convention, based primarily on legislative proposals previously presented in the area (see Ds 2007:10, Tort liability regarding violations of an individual’s freedom or personal integrity).</p>
<p>In our view, there are decisive arguments in favour of creating an independent statutory regulation that allows examination by a Swedish court, based on the requirements that follow from Article 13 of the European Convention. One important reason for this, in turn, is that such a solution allows an examination that may result in establishing that a violation of the Convention has occurred.</p>
<h2>Possibilities of obtaining damages for violations of the European Convention</h2>
<p>Our proposal involves the introduction of a new regulation that allows natural or legal persons to obtain damages from the state or a municipality for violations of the European Convention (Section 6.4). There are organisational and other reasons for placing the provision in the Tort Liability Act after the provisions on error or negligence while exercising pubic authority, such as Chapter 3, Section 3 of the Act (the present Section 3 will instead become a new Section 4). This will also make the regulation more accessible for individuals. However, it is inevitable that the formulation of the regulation will be somewhat different than the other regulations in the Tort Liability Act.</p>
<p>One result of placing the regulation in the Tort Liability Act is that an action against public authorities pursuant to the new regulation will be examined by a general court under the rules for optional proceedings. We have also considered the possibilities of establishing a special body for examining compensation claims based on the Convention, but have decided not to present such a proposal. This is because various special regulations of this kind could contribute to the fragmentation of tort law with unexpected and undesired consequences for related legal areas, including issues dealing with calculating the actual size of the compensation.</p>
<p>Under the new regulation, imposing liability for damages on public authorities will require a court determining that a “violation” of the petitioner’s rights under the Convention has occurred. When examining a damages claim pursuant to the regulation, the person applying the law must be convinced that a certain action or omission entails a violation of the Convention that gives rise to damages for public authorities. This includes the requirement of well-founded court findings with related arguments as to how, and in what way, a certain Convention article has been violated, with references to relevant European Court cases. This primarily means judgments and decisions delivered by the European Court of Human Rights Grand Chamber, and then in particular cases that allow more general conclusions on the contents of a certain Convention article.</p>
<p>Since the actual basis of liability itself refers to the European Convention, it follows that the regulation’s scope of application is defined on the basis of a state’s obligation to protect the human rights of individuals under the various Convention articles. In most cases, the regulation means that the state has liability; for example, regarding legislation and application of the law that is in violation of the Convention, or when public authorities have entrusted a private entity with a task that affects the rights of individuals under the Convention. However, there are decisive arguments in support of municipalities also having liability in certain cases, such as for violations committed by municipal bodies. In this respect, our proposal should primarily be seen as a codification of case law concerning municipal liability for violations of the European Convention (cf. NJA 2009 p. 463).</p>
<p>Another issue is which types of damages should be covered by the new provision. It is clear that in certain cases, Article 13 may require a damages penalty for both pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage. However, there is no reason to introduce new types of damages in Swedish law if such is not necessary in view of the requirements of the Convention. In light of this we propose that, under the regulation, liability for damages should cover the types of damage found in the Tort Liability Act – i.e. personal injury, material damage, purely financial damage and infringement violations – and the special type of non-pecuniary damage that can arise through disregard of the European Convention. This kind of damage is termed “other damage” and is contained in a special item in the Act. The proposal calls for a statutory regulation of damage that until now has been compensated without having direct support in law, which is an advantage.</p>
<p>According to our terms of reference, the starting point for a statutory regulation is that “liability for damages is not to cover cases where the state fulfils the requirement of effective legal remedy in another way”. Therefore, the aim of the new damages regulation is, together with other legal remedies, to fulfil Sweden’s obligations under Article 13. How can this prerequisite be appropriately expressed in a legal text?</p>
<p>We have answered this question by setting the requirement that it must be “necessary” for redress to be provided for the infringement through financial compensation in the form of damages. The requirement is stated in the second paragraph of the regulation. In this way it is made clear that damages are not always the type of redress to be considered first for violations of the European Convention. This means that an assessment is required of whether, and to what extent, other legal remedies have been available and sufficiently effective within the meaning of Article 13 of the Convention.</p>
<p>So what exactly is meant by the necessity requirement? It can be stated here that compensation that has been paid under other legislation, in line with the general rule, means that the requirements for providing legal remedy have been fulfilled. If financial damages are imposed pursuant to the new regulation or the regulation in Chapter 3, Section 2 of the Tort Liability Act, there may be cases in which the need to award non-pecuniary compensation for “other damage” is not as great. However, if other legal remedies have been found or used, the violation may still require further redress in the form of damages in some situations. This may be the case, for example, if just satisfaction has not been provided for the violation in another way, or for certain violations of Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention.</p>
<p>In all cases, the deciding factor is whether Article 13 or the Convention in general can be deemed to require that financial compensation be awarded pursuant to the regulation. Failure of the individual to appeal judgments and decisions without good reason normally affects their right to compensation, and often means that damages are not awarded. However, making use of extraordinary legal remedies (e.g. a new hearing) should not be required in order for damages to be awarded.</p>
<p>As regards the application of the regulation in general, we consider that it should not be required that the violation be serious, etc. In accordance with general principles, however, it is required that the damage is proven and that there is an adequate causal link between the damage and the violation in order for damages to be awarded. In other respects as well, the premise is that general tort liability principles are applicable, as long as the Convention does not explicitly state otherwise. Further, under the Inquiry’s proposal, there may be cases where the damage that has occurred is considered to be so limited or insignificant that damages are not awarded pursuant to the regulation.</p>
<p>Finally, the rules on calculating damages in Chapter 5 of the Tort Liability Act – including the provision on deductions for certain benefits provided by various insurance policies – are applicable in line with what is stated in each individual section of the law. The same applies for the adjustment rules, etc. in Chapter 6 of the Tort Liability Act. These issues are also dealt with in the section on calculating the size of damages (Section 6.5).</p>
<h2>Calculating compensation for certain types of nonpecuniary damage</h2>
<p>The new damages regulation introduces the opportunity to obtain compensation for non-pecuniary damage that is not linked to personal injury or infringement violations of the European Convention (cf. the phrase “other damage”). We consider, therefore, that a special regulation for calculating the compensation that may be payable for this kind of damage should be added to the chapter on the determination of liability for damages (Section 6.5). In order to highlight the connection between the new regulation and the compensation awarded for an infringement violation, it is proposed that the regulation be introduced in the form of a new paragraph in the provision on compensation for infringement violations (Chapter 5, Section 6 of the Tort Liability Act). This will also make clear that the premise should be that compensation awarded is on a par with compensation for infringement violations.</p>
<p>Which criteria should be laid down for compensation payable for “other damage” in line with the new compensation regulation?</p>
<p>As this is a matter of compensating a damage that cannot be quantified in money in the same way as pecuniary damage, it seems logical that compensation be determined on the basis of a general assessment of what is reasonable. This assessment should also take into account the nature and general circumstances of the violation.</p>
<p>The “nature of the violation” refers to the fact that the amount is determined in relation to the right in question and how far the violation has encroached on the right protected by the Convention. “General circumstances” primarily refers to subjective elements. However, the determining factor should be the typical way in which the established damage is experienced by a person in the injured party’s situation, i.e. a more objective examination. Importance may be attached to other circumstances as well; e.g. the existence of other legal remedies. Moreover, the courts should consider the case law of the European Court on just satisfaction in Article 41 of the Convention, especially cases in which Sweden has been a party.</p>
<h2>Need for other legislation – a special litigation cost regulation</h2>
<p>We did not consider it necessary to propose any special regulations in connection with the new damages regulation – e.g. concerning a time limitation for claims for damages – apart from one point. This concerns the issue of the distribution of litigation costs in damages cases regarding violations of the Convention (Section 6.7). The background is as follows.</p>
<p>It is possible that a court may rule that the state is liable under the European Convention, but does not award any damages. One reason for this may be that the damage that occurred was insignificant or that sufficient redress had been achieved through an earlier action. The consequence is that the case is dismissed. The individual party is then considered to have “lost” and is liable to pay for the winning party’s litigation costs under Chapter 18, Section 1 of the Swedish Code of Judicial Procedure. Other cost distribution options appear to be limited in such situations (cf. Chapter 18, Section 4 of the Code of Judicial Procedure). However, it cannot be ruled out that in some cases, the Convention may require a distribution that is more favourable for the complainant in relation to what applies under the Code of Judicial Procedure.</p>
<p>In light of the above, we consider that a special litigation costs regulation should be introduced to provide the opportunity to adjust public institution compensation or to provide for each party taking responsibility for their own costs in cases where claims for damages based on the Convention have been dismissed. We propose that the provision be introduced by means of a separate paragraph in the Tort Liability Act (Chapter 6, Section 7).</p>
<p>Unlike the provision on the distribution of litigation costs for compensation awarded for infringement violations (Chapter 6, Section 6 of the Tort Liability Act), the new regulation will be applicable for all damages for which compensation may be awarded for a violation of the Convention. For adjustment or offsetting to be possible under the regulation, the court must have established that a violation of the European Convention has occurred. In addition, there must be “special grounds” to deviate from the rules of the Code of Judicial Procedure. Assessments should take into account the requirements that follow from the right to access to a court of law and to effective legal remedies in Articles 6 and 13 of the Convention.</p>
<p>One example of a case where the provision may be applicable is when a case is dismissed as just satisfaction is considered to have been achieved in an earlier action at the same time as the complainant, in objective terms, is considered to have had well founded grounds to have a claim based on the Convention examined in a subsequent damages case against the state. Another possible case may be that an individual has applied to the Office of the Chancellor of Justice for damages before legal action has been initiated in a court of law, but that the Chancellor of Justice has refused to award compensation with reference to the fact that is has been particularly difficult to assess whether a violation has occurred. The new regulation may be applicable in this kind of situation as well. The party’s possibilities of obtaining legal aid should be taken into account.</p>
<h2>Repealing Chapter 3, Section 10 of the Tort Liability Act and other legislative amendments</h2>
<p>One consequence of our proposal for a new damages regulation is that the jurisdictional rule in Chapter 3, Section 10 of the Tort Liability Act will not apply in such cases (Section 6.8). This regulation only applies to actions conducted under Chapter 3, Section 2 of the Tort Liability Act and states that claims involving assertions that a court has committed an error incurring liability for damages are to be examined by the court immediately superior. However, claims made on the basis of the new regulation will be examined by a district court as the court of first instance. This means that damages claims against public authorities may need to be pursued in different courts depending on which grounds are cited. The same applies to compensation claims involving assertions of cumulative errors.</p>
<p>There are a number of reasons why actions against public authorities that are based on provisions in the Tort Liability Act – including the new damages regulation – or pursued on the basis of EU law should be dealt with in one proceeding. It should also be possible to have one’s claims examined at three different court levels, as is the case under the general rules. The grounds cited in support of the introduction of the jurisdictional rule – primarily grounds concerning financial and technical aspects of proceedings, as well as the principal that a lower court is not to examine the correctness of a decision taken by a higher court – should not be awarded the same significance now as when the provision was introduced.</p>
<p>In light of this, we propose that the provision be repealed. However, in view of time considerations and reasons specifically related to the inquiry, we will refrain from submitting any proposals concerning the constitutionally complex issue of amending or repealing the prohibition against proceedings in Chapter 3, Section 7 of the Tort Liability Act, which is not covered by the new damages regulation (Section 6.9).</p>
<p>Otherwise, the same processing procedure should apply for claims made against the state pursuant to the provision on error or negligence while exercising public authority in Chapter 3, Section 2 of the Tort Liability Act and the new damages regulation. Consequently, we propose that the Ordinance on Processing Claims for Damages against the State (1995:1301) be amended so that Sections 3–4 and Section 9 also include a reference to Chapter 3, Section 3 of the Tort Liability Act (Section 6.10).</p>
<h2>Entry into force and transitional provisions</h2>
<p>It should be possible for the new provisions to enter into force on 1 January 2012 (Section 7.2). The litigation costs rule is only to be applied in cases where a claim for damages has been made after entry into force. Beyond this, no special transitional provisions are deemed necessary. This means that the new damages regulation is to be applied to claims for compensation concerning cases of damage that occur after entry into force.</p>
