<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Our remit</h2>
<p>This part of our remit focuses on video surveillance of public transport and stations. Under the Video Surveillance Act ( Kamerabevakningslagen ), such video surveillance often requires a permit. However, video surveillance of metro cars and metro stations is covered by an exemption from the permit requirement (the ‘metro exemption’). Our remit includes analyzing whether an expanded exemption from the permit requirement for video surveillance of public transport and stations should be introduced. It also includes presenting the legislative proposals deemed appropriate. We are at liberty to consider and present legislative proposals concerning issues that are relevant to particular issues that are to be examined.</p>
<h2>Fundamental rights</h2>
<p>Video surveillance constitutes a violation of fundamental rights and freedoms. The rights that are primarily of interest to our remit are the right to protection of private life and personal privacy, and the right to protection of personal data. These rights are guaranteed by the European Convention on Human Rights, the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and the Instrument of Government of Sweden. There are two sides to the fundamental rights of individuals: the right of individuals to be protected from violations by the State, and the duty of the State to guarantee individuals protection against violations by other individuals. The State is obliged to establish a framework that provides for these partially competing interests.</p>
<p>The permit requirement contained in the Video Surveillance Act often applies to surveillance of public transport and areas of stations to which the general public has access. The permit requirement is intended to guarantee the individual more extensive protection against surveillance while giving the authorities appropriate opportunities to conduct video surveillance.</p>
<h2>The permit procedure entails several problems regarding surveillance in public transport and of airports</h2>
<p>With the aim of determining whether the permit procedure in practice entails appropriate opportunities to conduct surveillance of public transport and stations, we carried out a survey. Within the framework of the survey, a questionnaire was addressed to a number of actors active in the area. The questions in part focused on which problems the permit procedure entails. The survey shows that the permit procedure entails several problems regarding surveillance in public transport. It also entails problems regarding surveillance of airports. The permit requirement – which comprises an administrative burden in relation to the General Data Protection Regulation – entails a procedure that is demanding in terms of time and resources. Furthermore, the permit requirement prevents surveillance being used in a flexible manner and also leads to demarcation problems in relation to surveillance that does not require a permit. As a result, there are times when no permit is applied for even though there is a need for one. In this way, the permit requirement obstructs an efficient and appropriate use of video surveillance in public transport and at airports. It can also be noted that the ‘metro exemption’ stands out as being difficult to justify and entails demarcation problems.</p>
<h2>At the same time, the need of surveillance is perceived to be extensive</h2>
<p>The need of an expanded exemption from the permit requirement is primarily in reference to surveillance in public transport. Video surveillance is a tool used to enhance security among travelers, staff and others present in public transport. Our survey shows that there is an extensive need for video surveillance in public transport. This is because there are, to varying degrees, problems with crime and disturbances in public transport and at certain public transport hubs. The problem is not limited to urban areas, it is also present in small towns and in rural areas. It is especially evident in particularly vulnerable areas. In addition, public transport is a particular target for terrorist attacks. There is also a need of an expanded exemption from the permit requirement at airports. The benefit of surveillance is also perceived as being significant, not only to increase security in public transport but ultimately even in law enforcement. Furthermore, surveillance is needed to prevent accidents and limit the effects of any terrorist attacks. In other words, there is often a keen interest in surveillance.</p>
<h2>Privacy protection when using video surveillance is currently extensive, irrespective of a permit requirement</h2>
<p>In light of the strong general interest in surveillance and the need for and benefit of surveillance, it is important that opportunities to use surveillance are not hampered by a permit procedure, unless a procedure of this kind is justified by strong reasons of privacy. Still, protection of personal privacy has been reinforced, most recently through the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). One objective of this regulation is to protect fundamental rights and freedoms in connection with personal data processing. Accordingly, removing the permit requirement does not mean a green light for surveillance activities. Before starting surveillance activities, account must be taken of a number of considerations based on the provisions of the GDPR, including the question of proportionality. Irrespective of a permit requirement, the provisions of the GDPR provide extensive and corrective privacy protection. In addition, the GDPR provides strong privacy protection during the period in which video surveillance is in progress. Furthermore, the interest of protecting personal privacy does not always conflict with the interest of video surveillance, but can instead strengthen it. The conclusion therefore is that an expanded exemption from the permit requirement should now be introduced.</p>
<h2>The ‘metro exemption’ to be replaced by a new expanded exemption from the permit requirement</h2>
<p>We propose that the ‘metro exemption’ be replaced by a new expanded exemption from the permit requirement. The new exemption covers surveillance of more vehicles and places than metro cars and metro stations. In addition, the aim of surveillance will be expanded to also cover surveillance for the purpose of keeping order.</p>
<p>Initially, an exemption from the permit requirement will apply to surveillance of a vehicle used in public transport on roads, railways, water, trams or the metro. Furthermore, an exemption will apply for surveillance of a station area, terminal area or stop area intended for public travel on roads, railways, water, trams or the metro. The boundaries of such areas will be assessed in each individual case based on the conditions on site. Places directly connected to stations, terminals and stops that are constructed to facilitate travel by public transport, e.g. parking facilities for bicycles and cars, and passageways to and from such places, can often be part of a station, terminal or stop area.</p>
<p>The exemption from the permit requirement will also apply to surveillance of a place adjacent to railway, tram or metro tracks. The exemption focuses on places alongside the track where for some reason there is a risk of accidents, sabotage or personal attacks. Finally, an exemption from the permit requirement is proposed in surveillance of an airport area. The exemption focuses on the actual airport and adjacent environments, such as car parks.</p>
<p>It is proposed that the exemption apply to surveillance intended to anticipate, prevent or detect criminal activities, or to investigate or prosecute crimes. In addition, it is proposed to apply if the surveillance is aimed at anticipating, preventing or detecting disturbances of public order and security or accidents, or to limit the impact of such disturbances or accidents that have occurred.</p>
<h2>No supplementary privacy enhancement regulations needed in the Video Surveillance Act</h2>
<p>In our interim report ‘Video surveillance in law enforcement – a simpler procedure’ (SOU 2018:62), we proposed removing the permit requirement for the Swedish Police Authority and other central law enforcement authorities. At the same time, we proposed retaining a proportionality assessment for these authorities by means of the preponderance principle in the Video Surveillance Act. We presented several positive effects with such a solution in the interim report.</p>
<p>However, we do not propose introducing such a regulation with regard to public transport or for surveillance of airport areas. This is because the justification for having a clarifying privacy-enhancing regulation in the Video Surveillance Act regarding surveillance conducted by public transport actors and in airport areas is significantly weaker than for law enforcement authorities. Without a supplementary regulation in the Video Surveillance Act, it is admittedly reasonable to believe that for some time to come there will be a degree of uncertainty concerning the details of how corresponding proportionality assessments under the GDPR will be carried out. However, actors in the area of public transport do not have the powers vis-à-vis individuals that law enforcement authorities have. The same applies to actors that maintain surveillance at airports. It is therefore considered that the fact that there will be a degree of uncertainty regarding application of the law will not affect the rights and freedoms of individuals in the same way as when there is uncertainty for law enforcement authorities. Our basic premise has been that there must not be any doubt when it comes to how law enforcement authorities may use video surveillance.</p>
<p>A solution that does not retain a proportionality assessment by means of the preponderance principle in the Video Surveillance Act also corresponds best to a uniform regulation in the sector. This solution also means that surveillance in the metro will not be comprised of more extensive administration than at present, which may entail a prerequisite for our remit.</p>
<h2>Increased importance of supervision and internal controls</h2>
<p>Even without a permit procedure, the GDPR’s regulation on prior consultations provides a type of prior examination of the supervisory authority. This regulation becomes relevant in the event of high privacy risks. The Swedish Data Protection Authority has far-reaching powers within the framework of a prior consultation. In extreme cases, envisaged video surveillance may be prohibited. Our assessment is that, in cases where a prior consultation has been conducted, the corrective supervision will not be significantly altered in relation to whether the permit requirement applies.</p>
<p>However, in cases where the regulation on prior consultation is not relevant, the actors involved will themselves assess whether surveillance is compatible with the provisions of the GDPR. The opportunities to conduct efficient corrective supervision will be more important in these cases. However, the provisions of the GDPR provide good opportunities for efficient corrective supervision. For example, the supervisory authority can decide to issue injunctions, restrictions or prohibitions. Furthermore, there is a risk that the person responsible for video surveillance may be subject to administrative fines.</p>
<p>In light of the less stringent provisions we propose, it is very important that actors in the area conduct efficient and extensive internal controls in addition to efficient supervision conducted by the Swedish Data Protection Authority. It is also important that, in consultation with the Swedish Data Protection Authority, the industries draw up codes of conduct in the area of video surveillance. This will create good conditions for a correct application of the GDPR as regards video surveillance in public transport and of airport areas.</p>
<h2>Consequences of the proposals</h2>
<p>The proposals will simplify the relevant actors’ work with video surveillance, since they will no longer need to apply for a permit before beginning video surveillance. The proposals entail increased responsibility for the actors who, to a greater extent, will themselves conduct assessments of the legality of a surveillance. They will allow a more flexible use of video surveillance in public transport and at airport areas than at present. They will probably lead to increased surveillance in public transport and at airport areas.</p>
<p>The proposals are expected to have positive effects on securityenhancing efforts in public transport. Ultimately, they will also lead to positive effects for law enforcement and legal certainty. Furthermore, the proposals will encourage collaboration between law enforcement authorities and actors in the area of public transport and airport operators.</p>
<p>However, the fact that surveillance in public transport and at airports will not be covered by a permit requirement may entail certain risks for an individual’s privacy. Still, these risks are reduced through the protection provided by the GDPR. To the extent that our proposals result in fewer crimes and enhanced security, they also entail greater protection of an individual’s privacy.</p>
<p>As has been made clear above, our proposals may contribute to a more secure public transport environment. As a result, the proposals may contribute to more people using public transport, which is in line with society’s objective of significantly increasing the scope of public transport. More travel using public transport also provides the conditions for achieving society’s objectives regarding public transport’s accessibility, reduced congestion in cities and a reduced climate impact.</p>
<p>The proposals are not expected to lead to increased costs for the relevant actors.</p>
<h2>Entry into force and transitional provisions</h2>
<p>It is suggested that the proposals enter into force on 1 January 2020. At the same time, the permits issued to relevant actors will cease to apply provided they pertain to surveillance activities that are no longer covered by the permit requirement.</p>
