<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>The assignment</h2>
<p>The principal task of the inquiry has been to conduct a review of the regulations within the public sector concerning extra-occupational activities. In particular we were asked to analyse the regulation of extraoccupational activities that adversely affect confidence and check how the regulations are followed. Among other things, this has also involved conducting a survey of the extent and nature of the extra-occupational activities of public servants; proposing changes that might be deemed suitable to consider if there is due cause to change the current basic system of regulating extra-occupational activities by constitutional and contractual legislation; and paying particular attention to the regulations concerning the extra-occupational activities of judges.</p>
<h2>Current regulations</h2>
<p>Public servants employed by the state, the municipalities, the county councils and social insurance offices are not allowed to have extraoccupational activities that might adversely affect confidence in their impartiality (extra-occupational activities adversely affecting confidence). An employer can also forbid employees from having extraoccupational activities that have an adverse effect on the performance of their duties (extra-occupational activities adversely affecting working practices) or such extra-occupational activities that result in the employee competing with the activities of the authority (extra-occupational activities of a competitive nature).</p>
<p>An extra-occupational activity is defined as any employment, assignment or other activity that an employee engages in apart from his or her principal employment. Attending to the affairs of an individual or a family is not considered to be an extra-occupational activity.</p>
<p>The extra-occupational activities of state employees are regulated in two different ways: the Public Employment Act prohibits extraoccupational activities adversely affecting confidence; while extraoccupational activities adversely affecting working practices and activities of a competitive nature are regulated in the collective agreements between the parties on the state labour market. These same two sets of regulations apply to those employed by the social insurance offices. For employees of municipalities and county councils, on the other hand, both extra-occupational activities adversely affecting working practices and those of a competitive nature are covered by collective agreements.</p>
<p>The prohibition against extra-occupational activities adversely affecting confidence arises from the particular demands concerning integrity that the public service sector makes of its employees. These requirements are inherent in the form of government, since this requires courts and administrative authorities to be objective and impartial.</p>
<h2>The survey of the extra-occupational activities of public employees</h2>
<p>In order to provide a basis for deliberations and proposals, the inquiry enlisted the services of Statistics Sweden (SCB). A questionnaire was sent to approximately 15,000 public employees asking for information about their extra-occupational activities. This contained questions about the extent of extra-occupational activities and asked for information about them, the time devoted to them and the reasons for having them.</p>
<p>According to the study, 21% of public employees have one or more extra-occupational activities. When the results are compared to those of a similar study that was conducted towards the end of the 1960's, this represents a decline of 8 percentage points. Whether public servants are employed by the state, the municipalities, the county councils or the social insurance offices, the number engaged in extra-occupational activities is approximately the same. However, there are major differences between various groups of employees. Extra-occupational activities are much more common among heads of civil service departments and judges, for example.</p>
<p>As a result of the study, the committee came to the conclusion that the total frequency of extra-occupational activities among public employees, taking into account the extent of extra-occupational activities and what is meant by the concept, cannot be considered noteworthy or a cause for concern. A significant proportion of the extraoccupational activities of public employees are conducted on behalf of other public authorities, public administrations or non-profit associations.</p>
<p>However, the inquiry would point out that there is generally considerable room for improvement as far as employers are concerned, both when it comes to informing their employees about the rules concerning extraoccupational activities, and making use of the opportunities that exist to obtain information about them.</p>
<h2>Evaluation of regulations and established practice</h2>
<p>Having reviewed a considerable amount of the established practice that exists concerning extra-occupational activities, the inquiry has come to the conclusion that this is relatively uniform, stable and well-balanced. There is scope in The Public Employment Act, section 7, for individual judgement to be applied. However, improvements could be made both in the way that employees are informed about extra-occupational activities, and with respect to the opportunities available to the state employers to enquire about them. Similarly, since there is a division between legislation and agreement, this has sometimes been considered to cause problems of application.</p>
<h2>Considerations and proposals</h2>
<p>Extra-occupational activities adversely affecting confidence</p>
<p>Of the three principal types of extra-occupational activities that are not permitted, those that adversely affect confidence have always been the ones that have attracted most attention. In accordance with the directive, a review of the regulations concerning this type of extraoccupational activity has also been the principal task of this inquiry.</p>
<p>The inquiry considers that established practice indicates that the regulations concerning extra-occupational activities adversely affecting confidence in most cases fulfil the requirement that it should be possible to terminate such activities. Nor should the extent of the extraoccupational activities revealed by the statistical study be taken to mean that the regulations as such need to be made more stringent. Neither established practice nor the occurrence of extra-occupational activities therefore constitute any particular reason to make any major changes of substance in the current regulations in order to expand or limit the extent of the prohibition against extra-occupational activities. Those problems that are to be found in particular areas are more due to a lack of both information about the regulations and checks to ensure that they are followed rather than their actual purport. The inquiry therefore considers that rather than extending the regulations concerning prohibition in</p>
<p>general, better checks should be implemented in particular areas, especially with respect to authorities and administrations concerned with the exercise of public authority, supervision and procurement.</p>
<p>While the regulations in general have neither "missed" any particular type of extra-occupational activity nor given rise to any major problems concerning their application, this should naturally not be taken to imply that such is never the case. On the other hand the disadvantages of a less flexible and more detailed regulation of various activities, areas of administration, groups of employees or types of extra-occupational activities must be considered to outweigh the advantages when an increase in specialised regulation is compared to the general rules of the type that are in force at the present time. For this reason, and as a result of the scepticism with respect to such legislation that we encountered in our dealings with authorities and others, we have abstained from implementing new, specialised rules.</p>
<p>The inquiry does not therefore propose any changes as such with respect to the regulations concerning extra-occupational activities adversely affecting confidence. However, since applying a general rule can be difficult, not least for an employee, there are grounds for attempting to clarify the matter by giving some guidance with respect to certain circumstances that are significant when it comes to evaluating an extraoccupational activity. We have therefore proposed that those occupational activities in which the risk that confidence may be adversely affected is particularly acute should be listed in the regulations. These areas are: the administration of justice, the exercise of public authority, supervision, procurement, the administration of property, and the leadership of a public administration. In addition, the inquiry has come to the conclusion that the current special regulations for the tax authority and the customs can be rescinded.</p>
<p>The extra-occupational activities of judges</p>
<p>At the present time, the general rules concerning extra-occupational activities are the same as the ones that apply to other employees of the state. The inquiry feels there is reason to emphasize that there should be extremely careful deliberation, both on the part of the judge and the party intending to enlist the judge for a particular assignment. One cannot ignore the fact that the profession of a judge entails such special tasks and such a special role in society, that the requirement of public confidence is particularly strong when it comes to the activities of the courts. However, the inquiry has come to the conclusion that the advantages of having a general rule, with scope for the evaluation of each individual case, is also applicable to judges. It has not been deemed necessary to implement a particular prohibition for any category of judge. On the other hand the inquiry has expressed what it considers to be the purport, as far as judges are concerned, of current rules concerning extra-occupational activities: among other things that acting as an arbitrator or sitting on the board of a profit-making company, with few exceptions, cannot be considered compatible with section 7 of the Public Employment Act.</p>
<p>Extra-occupational activities that adversely affect working practices or are competitive in nature</p>
<p>The conclusion of the inquiry is that extra-occupational activities adversely affecting working practices are not generally a problem. By and large it is up to the management to solve such problems where they exist. Current rules enable employers to put a stop to extra-occupational activities that adversely affect working practices.</p>
<p>Extra-occupational activities of a competitive nature do not seem to be a problem either. The inquiry is of the opinion that it is the employing authority that is best in a position to assess whether an extraoccupational activity is competitive and damaging or not. It is therefore proposed that assessment upon the part of the state should be done by the authority/employer - as is already done at municipal level - and not, as is current practice, by the government.</p>
<p>By means of improved information from the employers and the inquiry's proposal that disclosure by employees should be obligatory, it is anticipated that the number of problems that may arise can be expected to diminish, both as regards competitive extra-occupational activities and those that adversely affect working practices.</p>
<p>A new system of checks</p>
<p>The authority and obligation that employers have to react to extraoccupational activities that adversely affect confidence, and act at an early stage, must be improved, particularly as far as the state is concerned. This is something that has also been pointed out to the inquiry during many of the contacts that were made with authorities. In order to evaluate issues concerning extra-occupational activities before the damage is done and the confidence of the public is lost, it is important that it should become a natural subject for employers and employees to discuss together. The inquiry has proposed that an employer who is made aware of an extra-occupational activity that adversely affects confidence, should be obliged to instruct the employee either to desist or</p>
<p>not to undertake the activity. By obliging employers to inform employees about what sort of circumstances can make an extra-occupational activity one that adversely affects confidence, while at the same time obliging an employee to supply an employer, when asked, with the information needed for an employer to evaluate an employee's extraoccupational activities, it should be possible for a reasoned discussion to take place on an ongoing basis and in most cases this should not lead to drastic measures being taken. It should be considered self-evident that an employee is entitled to be told by an employer what the latter's view is of the permissibility of an extra-occupational activity. The regulation of this in section 12 of the Employment Regulation can thus be rescinded.</p>
<p>The rules for extra-occupational activities that adversely affect confidence are to be found in the Public Employment Act and are also applicable to municipalities and county councils. For practical reasons, the employee's obligation to disclose should apply to all types of extraoccupational activities. Reviews of decisions concerning extraoccupational activities can be made consistent by enabling the Labour Court to review both those decisions concerning extra-occupational activities that are made in accordance with the Public Employment Act as well as those decisions concerning extra-occupational activities that adversely affect working practices or are competitive in nature that have been decided on the basis of collective agreements.</p>
<p>The particular standing of judges and the particular implications for the rule of law that is entailed by an evaluation of their extraoccupational activities, has led the inquiry to propose that judges who have been employed as the result of a government decision, should, on their own initiative, inform their employers about their extraoccupational activities. According to this suggestion, the National Swedish Judiciary Administration's Committee For Official Proposals would be the body responsible for all evaluations. Among other things, this would mean that the information would then be in the public domain. The obligation to disclose would be incorporated into the legislation.</p>
<p>Even director-generals, county governors, other heads of administrative authorities that report directly to the government and directors of social insurance offices, would have a legal obligation to notify their extra-occupational activities, in these cases to the government or the board of the social insurance office.</p>
<p>Regulation by statute or agreement</p>
<p>The prohibition against extra-occupational activities that adversely affect confidence has the same purpose at municipal and county council</p>
<p>level as it has a government level. The intention is to maintain the confidence of the public that the administration acts in an objective and impartial manner. This applies with as much force at the municipal level as it does at the state level. This is a matter of public interest that is independent of the relationship that pertains between employer and employee.</p>
<p>At the present time the municipalities and county councils are responsible for the overwhelming majority of the public administration. The public, whose confidence in the administration the regulations concerning extra-occupational activities are intended to protect, has at least as much contact with the municipal administration as it has with the state administration. The municipal administrations exert authority, supervision and control and are in charge of procurement in the same manner as the state authorities. The inquiry has therefore come to the conclusion that it is in principle wrong to incorporate a prohibition against activities that adversely affect confidence in collective agreements, and that there are sound reasons for regulating the prohibition by means of statute at the municipal level as well. It is the opinion of the inquiry that such a prohibition with its ancillary regulations cannot be deemed to encroach upon the autonomy of the municipalities. The reasons that have been put forward in support of the proposal that regulations in the municipal sector should always be gathered in one place are almost of a practical nature and do not outweigh the objections in principle to regulation by agreement.</p>
<p>The inquiry has therefore proposed that the regulations concerning extra-occupational activities in the Public Employment Act should apply throughout the entire public sector. The same reasons of principle as those concerning extra-occupational activities adversely affecting confidence do not apply with respect to extra-occupational activities adversely affecting working practices or those of a competitive nature. These should therefore continue to be regulated by agreements between the parties on the labour market in all parts of the public sector.</p>
<p>Costs etc</p>
<p>It is the opinion of the inquiry that these proposals do not entail any economic or other consequences of significance that need to be accounted for separately.</p>
