<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Remit</h2>
<p>My remit in the Inquiry on High-Speed Railways has been to investigate the conditions for the development of high-speed railway tracks in Sweden. In accordance with my terms of reference I have analysed whether a future development of high-speed railway tracks can help to achieve socially efficient and sustainable transport solutions for an enhanced transport system with better capacity, mobility and accessibility.</p>
<h2>Starting points</h2>
<p>In line with the Inquiry’s terms of reference, my proposals start from the transport policy objectives, current principles for financing infrastructure investments and the forms for levying track access charges. The ongoing introduction of new rules for market access for rail traffic has also been taken into account in the work of the Inquiry. With regard to the possibility of cofinancing, I have followed work on the revision of the regulatory framework concerning the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T).</p>
<p>In this report the term high-speed railways means railways dimensioned for speeds of over 250 kilometers per hour.</p>
<h2>High-speed railways – social infrastructure for stronger development and competitiveness</h2>
<p>The present Swedish railway network and its main lines were planned and began to be built in the middle of the 19th century. Large parts of the 20th century saw a very substantial concentration of population, especially in the metropolitan areas. The growth of the metropolitan cities in combination with better communications has led to the expansion of labour market regions and made it possible for people to settle further and further from their workplaces. This has, in turn, led to more traffic and new traffic systems. The present metropolitan areas are expected to account for 80 per cent of population growth up until 2030. In the longer term Linköping and Norrköping are also expected to make up a metropolitan region.</p>
<p>To meet the future demand for transport and the challenges facing society, it is my view that we are standing at a crossroad where more investment in infrastructure, and not least in railways, in Sweden is a very important factor. We have to meet tomorrow’s needs for transport in terms of cost-efficiency, capacity and development.</p>
<p>In my view, building high-speed railways in Sweden would create the conditions for a completely new transport system with better potential for effective goods and passenger transport that will make a crucial contribution to the development of the country. This applies not least to goods transport, since the capacity released in the present railway system will be of very great importance for the possibility of increasing the share of goods transport taken by rail. My assessment is that competitive travel times can be achieved on many routes with traffic using both highspeed railways and conventional tracks. The traffic alternatives I outline will lead to marked improvements in the accessibility of a large number of communities, even beyond the high-speed network itself.</p>
<p>As a result of the shorter travel times, labour market regions will expand, thus creating conditions for growth and development. The role of the metropolitan cities as communications centres with links to Arlanda, Skavsta, Landvetter and Kastrup will be strengthened. I see an introduction of high-speed railways as a social infrastructure project that will also influence society and its structures as a whole, over and above its direct effects in the form of a very efficient system of passenger transport and a more efficient system of goods transport.</p>
<p>At the same time, we should be aware that high-speed railways involve a very substantial investment and that the negative impacts of the project and its risks are not negligible.</p>
<h2>Cost-benefit analyses and assessment of the various alternatives</h2>
<p>In accordance with my terms of reference, I have compared the development of separate high-speed railways with upgrading and expanding existing railways. A proposal for action to upgrade the southern and western main lines has been prepared. However, it has not been possible, within the time limit for the Inquiry, to carry out a cost-benefit analysis for this alternative. My evaluation of both the alternatives is therefore based on the extent to which they contribute to the fulfilment of the objectives of transport policy.</p>
<p>I have had cost-benefit analyses done for the construction of separate high-speed railways between Stockholm and Malmö and Stockholm and Göteborg. In accordance with my terms of reference, the analyses have been carried out using generally accepted calculation methods, which means, in practice, the same methods as are used by the traffic agencies as part of their ongoing planning of measures.</p>
<p>The Swedish Rail Administration has calculated the cost of the construction of the two railways in line with my proposals at SEK 125 billion.</p>
<p>The result of the cost benefit analysis shows a positive net benefit-cost ratio of 0.15. This means that the social benefits of the project are somewhat larger than the social costs. However, in view of the size of the project and the risks associated with this, I consider that further study should be made of the cost-benefit analysis presented here.</p>
<p>In my view, the positive effects that cannot be quantified in the cost-benefit analysis are important to consider. The private profitability of the traffic is assessed as good, which means that the traffic can help to pay for the railway investments.</p>
<p>My conclusion from the result of the cost-benefit assessment and an evaluation of the achievement of transport policy objectives is that high-speed railways are a better alternative than upgrading and expanding the main rail lines. My proposal is that separate high-speed railways for passenger traffic should be built between Stockholm-Malmö and between Stockholm-Göteborg.</p>
<h2>Choice of routes and assessments of environmental aspects</h2>
<p>A high-speed railway between Stockholm and Göteborg will consist of 440 kilometres of new double track railway between Järna in Stockholm and Almedal in Göteborg.</p>
<p>Up to Jönköping the track to Malmö will be the same as to Göteborg. A total of around 300 kilometres of new double track railway will be built on the route between Jönköping and Malmö. I have investigated four alternative routes for the railway south of Jönköping. My conclusion is that the route that should be chosen is Jönköping-Värnamo-Helsingborg/Hässleholm-Malmö</p>
<p>A new railway will have a considerable impact on the environment, the landscape and the built environment. However, in this phase of planning for a development of high-speed railways it is not possible to identify exactly what impacts the railway will have on the environment. The environmental assessment conducted as part of the Inquiry has been intended to describe the typical impact and effects that high-speed railways could have on the environment and to make recommendations for further planning.</p>
<p>It is inevitable that high-speed railways will encroach on the landscape. The tracks are somewhat harder to adapt to the landscape on account of their larger curve radius; however, the tracks can cope with a larger gradient which reduces the encroachment on the landscape. The environmental assessment indicates that no crucial differences are involved compared with the development of conventional railways. The risk of negative impacts can be reduced by the choice of locations and various adaptive measures. These measures may result in higher costs.</p>
<p>With regard to health and the population, the overall impact of the high-speed railways is assessed as positive, in part as a result of higher accessibility and lower emissions from the transport sector.</p>
<h2>The link to the European high-speed rail network</h2>
<p>It will be possible to link a Swedish high-speed network with the European high-speed network, on condition that existing track in Denmark and northern Germany is upgraded and reinforced through measures to increase capacity. However, the prospects of driving trains at more than 250 kilometres per hour are judged to be small. Trains can operate at up to 160 kilometres per hour on the tracks in Denmark and northern Germany if planned and approved upgrades and capacity reinforcements are implemented.</p>
<h2>Model for implementation and financing</h2>
<p>The state should set up a project company to coordinate state action and be responsible for planning, design and procurement and for the future management of agreements relating to highspeed railways. The company would bear the state’s risks in the project and deal with grants from the EU, regions and municipallities.</p>
<p>Vehicles for passenger traffic on these railways will be acquired and paid for by the operators themselves. The stations along the railway will be owned and managed by Jernhusen AB, other property companies or local actors, such as municipalities. In organisational terms the stations should be outside the project.</p>
<p>A significant proportion of the project can be financed privately and be paid for by traffic revenue. Cofinancing from operators should be based on the track access charges they can bear. Cofinancing from the municipalities and regions affected should be based on the benefits, chiefly in the form of shorter travel times. My assessment is that cofinancing from the municipalities and regions affected can total SEK 19 billion. Cofinancing from the EU has been estimated at SEK 4 billion.</p>
<p>In all, private financing and cofinancing from the EU, municipalities and regions is estimated to amount to 53 per cent of the total investment cost. State financing, via appropriations to the Swedish Rail Administration, is estimated to amount to SEK 59 billion, corresponding to 47 per cent of the total investment.</p>
<p>I also present an implementation model in which the state finances the project without the involvement of private capital but where the operators’ capacity to pay is mobilised.</p>
<h2>Planning, design and construction</h2>
<p>In my view, the Government and Riksdag should take a single unified decision covering financing and the construction of highspeed railways on the Stockholm–Malmö and Stockholm–Göteborg routes. This development should be implemented as a coordinated project with one principal – the project company – to optimise planning, construction and the start of traffic.</p>
<p>Development of the railways should be divided up into a number of blocks of 100–160 kilometres of new double tracks for high-speed traffic according to the following preliminary grouping:</p>
<p>Stage 1</p>
<p>• Järna–Linköping</p>
<p>• Almedal–Borås</p>
<p>Stage 2</p>
<p>• Linköping–Jönköping</p>
<p>• Jönköping–Markaryd</p>
<p>• Markaryd–Åkarp</p>
<p>Stage 3</p>
<p>• Jönköping–Borås</p>
<p>This grouping permits the gradual start of traffic in 2023–2025. The proposed timetable will only be realistic if all the proposals are considered as a single package.</p>
<p>The planning process will be coordinated and implemented by the project company, in which all the actors involved, including the municipalities, should take part in the planning process from the outset. Each block will have its own project management. A project-wide management organisation will coordinate the work.</p>
