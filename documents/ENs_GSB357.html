<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>The present system of market surveillance was established when Sweden became a member of the EEA. Ten years of experiences coupled with a new product safety directive and possible future changes to the new approach have highlighted the need for a review of market surveillance in Sweden.</p>
<p>Over the past twelve months, the Commission on the Organisation of Market Surveillance (MKU) has been looking into a possible new structure. It has concluded that the strong role of the national sectoral agencies in Sweden must be respected and that they should be the focal points for market surveillance in their special sectors in the European Union.</p>
<p>This conclusion automatically leads to the need for other decisions:</p>
<p>A national target must be set for what the government agencies should achieve. Market surveillance must be incorporated into the regular performance management system, thus creating a clearer relation between objectives, funding and performance.</p>
<p>Stronger coordination is needed between the authorities. Operational control at the local level must be secured even if the</p>
<p>sectoral agencies do not have an operational control structure of their own.</p>
<p>Contact between Customs and the sectoral agencies needs to be organised.</p>
<p>Regarding coordination, Sweden has chosen to strengthen the role of SWEDAC, which is already presiding over a council for market surveillance. The MKU proposes that the Council be given a stronger role through a special ordinance. The ordinance also specifies which authorities are market surveillance authorities and defines the requirements for cooperation between them. The Council must report problems to the government on a yearly basis. The National Board of Trade and Swedish Customs will take active</p>
<p>part in the Council, which will also be a forum for methodological discussions.</p>
<p>With the proposed decentralised model of organisation, the practical control system becomes, to some extent, the responsibility of every authority. Some of them already have a local structure. Others will need to find alternative solutions, such as cooperation with other authorities, the use of private companies for certain tasks, etc. Many can exercise market control from the central office.</p>
<p>A number of different market surveillance authorities and no special focal point together create a need for organised cooperation between these authorities and Customs. So far, contact between them has not functioned as well as could be expected. The steps to be taken include the amendment of rules relating to the exchange of information between authorities and rules on secrecy.</p>
<p>In conclusion, to achieve stronger market surveillance the question of financing is perhaps the most important question of all. Financing, or rather lack of financing, appears to have resulted in weaker than expected activity. It is therefore vital that there is sufficient funding of market surveillance. The MKU is of the view that Swedenâ€™s earlier decision to normaly use fees for financing must be reconsidered.</p>
