<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Debt restructuring for entrepreneurs and their family members Our remit</h2>
<p>The Inquiry has been instructed to present proposals that give entrepreneurs who are personally liable for debts that have arisen in their business activities broader opportunities for debt restructuring. The remit has included considering the specific conditions that should apply for entrepreneurs to qualify for debt restructuring and the form the procedure should take.</p>
<p>The term ‘entrepreneur’ means a natural person who runs or has run a business. Legal persons will continue to be excluded from the debt restructuring system.</p>
<p>Swedish entrepreneurs have little opportunity to be granted debt restructuring and, by international standards, it is difficult for Swedish entrepreneurs to have their business-related debts written off. In order to reduce the risks involved in responsible business activities, we propose a special form of debt restructuring for entrepreneurs, which will give over-indebted entrepreneurs the opportunity of a second chance, bring the conditions for running a business in Sweden closer to conditions in the rest of Europe and plug a gap in Swedish insolvency law. A change of this kind has great symbolic value and can be expected to benefit growth-promoting entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>Debt restructuring for entrepreneurs should primarily be available to debtors with a burden of debt that has mainly arisen in a business operation that has been wound up by bankruptcy or in some other way. Entrepreneurs running businesses that are still operating should also be eligible for debt restructuring for entrepreneurs, given certain conditions, as should family members of entrepreneurs who have become over-indebted through their involvement in a business run by a spouse, partner, parent or child.</p>
<p>The new form of debt restructuring should only be available to serious entrepreneurs. The entrepreneur must therefore have run the business in a defensible and responsible manner for the entrepreneur or a family member to be eligible for this form of debt restructuring.</p>
<p>The length of the payment plan should be three years, which is in line with the recommendation in the area recently adopted by the European Commission. Shortening the payment period for entrepreneurs is warranted given the need to reduce the risks they run. But it is also reasonable given that an entrepreneur seeking debt restructuring must be able to pay at least SEK 5 000 per quarter to her or his creditors, whereas ordinary debtors undergoing debt restructuring may pay a much lower amount or even be granted complete relief from payment.</p>
<h2>Sweden needs debt restructuring for serious entrepreneurs Being an entrepreneur involves many challenges</h2>
<p>Where small and medium-sized enterprises are concerned, both the entrepreneur personally and those around them often equate the entrepreneur and the enterprise, regardless of the legal form of the business. Even if the entrepreneur’s success depends primarily on her or his skill, entrepreneurship always involves a certain degree of risk-taking. A failure can be due to circumstances beyond the entrepreneur’s control. Despite this, a business failure is commonly perceived as a personal failure for the entrepreneur.</p>
<p>Even if an entrepreneur naturally has to reckon with defaulted payments and external change, such changes can hit an entrepreneur hard. Sometimes it only requires a customer or a supplier to change their policy or terms of payment for the entrepreneur to have difficulty making the business profitable. External changes such as political decisions, changes in patterns of consumption, changes in the state of the economy, etc., can have a similar impact.</p>
<p>This in turn can lead to a reduction or complete loss of income for the entrepreneur. Just like employees, entrepreneurs can suffer illness, separation or other crises that affect their ability to work. For employees and entrepreneurs alike, certain expenses remain even when income disappears. But entrepreneurs are often much more severely affected. They generally have fixed business-related expenses in addition to private expenses and their safety nets are often less generous and secure. Moreover, employees who experience a loss of income because of sick leave or even unemployment are often seen as innocent victims of unfortunate circumstances, whereas a business bankruptcy often entails a stigma that suggests the entrepreneur is to blame. Although the vast majority of business bankruptcies affect entrepreneurs who are trying to act correctly but fail due to circumstances beyond their control, it is still easier in Sweden for an employee to obtain debt relief for consumer debts than for a person running a business who has debts that have arisen through honest entrepreneurship. We would like to see a more positive approach to business debts in debt restructuring contexts.</p>
<p>To some extent, running a business is a gamble. There is always a certain risk of failing and it is often difficult for a person who incurs a financial loss to bounce back. This is unfortunate not just for the individual concerned but also for society in general. A failure that leads to social exclusion is very costly for society. But a failure that results in a serious and capable entrepreneur being unable or unwilling to make a fresh start also means that Sweden loses new enterprises that could have created economic growth. Several studies show a positive link between new enterprises and economic growth. It is therefore important that a serious entrepreneur who has failed can be given a second chance.</p>
<p>There is a saying that goes: “ You learn from your mistakes ”. The risk of failing decreases with greater experience. For a person who is employed, this generally means that the difficulty of the tasks and responsibility of the individual increase with greater experience. Any failures are borne by the employer, while the employee rarely suffers any personal financial loss. For an entrepreneur, on the other hand, a mistake can be devastating. Entrepreneurs can incur personal debts from which they will never be free. If entrepreneurs are instead allowed to learn from their mistakes, more good business ideas might be turned into reality. More weight should be given to the fact that entrepreneurs who have failed are precisely the ones who are most likely to succeed in future business ventures. Or, in the words of Thomas Friedman, an influential American journalist: “ If you can’t fail, you won’t start” . In a growing market economy, the birth of new business operations and demise of old ones is a natural and necessary process. Many successful companies would not have existed if their owners had given up after a first attempt. Many technical innovations would not have come into being if entrepreneurs had not been prepared to invest and risk their assets, their income and their social status.</p>
<p>The attitude towards over-indebted people is different in the United States than in Europe. This in turn is because of different conditions, which lead to differences in the granting of credit and other areas. We would like to emphasise that we have not found any evidence that one system is better than the other; we merely observe that the systems differ.</p>
<p>In the US system, writing off liabilities is regarded as an efficient way to distribute risks. Over-indebtedness is seen as a market failure and is explained as a failure of the market to assess the risks. With this approach, it is logical to regard debt restructuring as a means of efficiently tackling problems of over-indebtedness so as to enable the individual to rapidly return to the market as a consumer and borrower. It has been pointed out that in Europe overindebtedness is regarded as a social or moral problem and that the debtor is expected to bear more of the risk. Debt restructuring for private persons, which is known as ‘personal bankruptcy’ in the US, where it became available in 1978, was only introduced in Europe in the 1980s and 1990s. The European approach is characterised by not making debt restructuring available to everyone and not letting it be perceived as an ‘easy way out’.</p>
<p>The Swedish Debt Relief Act was drafted in the context of the European approach. However, so far in Sweden we have had a more forgiving attitude towards employees who have become overindebted as a result of extensive consumption than towards serious entrepreneurs who have taken conscious and objectively justifiable risks in order to realise a business idea and create more jobs. As a result, Swedish entrepreneurs have little opportunity, by international comparison, to have their debts written off after a bankruptcy. This approach has brought criticism from the OECD, which found in a report in 2007 that the risks of running a business in Sweden need to be limited relative to the risks in comparable countries.</p>
<h2>Why is it difficult for entrepreneurs to obtain debt restructuring under the ordinary Debt Relief Act?</h2>
<p>In the preparatory materials for the Debt Relief Act, the legislators emphasised the importance of giving failed entrepreneurs a second chance. So it is paradoxical that natural persons running business operations were previously completely excluded from the scope of the Debt Relief Act. An entrepreneur can now be granted debt restructuring without prior bankruptcy, but only if the financial circumstances of the business are easily analysed. The provision should be seen against the backdrop that debt restructuring is intended to be a simple and quick procedure, but in practice the result has been that the door continues to be closed to active entrepreneurs wishing to obtain debt restructuring. It has also proved difficult to make an assessment of absolute insolvency concerning a person running or intending to start a company, since their future income is often uncertain. Over a period of just over two years, only 69 entrepreneurs have obtained or will obtain debt restructuring, even though the Swedish Enforcement Authority and the Government both expected the latest legislative amendment to result in several thousand sole entrepreneurs having their debts restructured. There is nothing to prevent an entrepreneur from applying for debt restructuring once the business has been declared bankrupt. Debts from previous business activities are normally covered and are even expected to be treated positively in the general assessment of reasonableness. An entrepreneur who obtains employment after the completion of bankruptcy proceedings can therefore normally obtain debt restructuring. In contrast, a person who wants to start a new business is generally unable to obtain debt restructuring as it is often impossible to assess their future ability to pay with any certainty. This system is neither logical nor appropriate.</p>
<h2>A new act on debt restructuring for entrepreneurs and their family members</h2>
<p>It should be possible to open the door to debt restructuring for entrepreneurs by amending the Debt Relief Act. However, the legislative authorities have attempted to open the way for entrepreneurs through several amendments, but have failed. Entrepreneurs are still excluded from the debt restructuring system since it is difficult to make an assessment of absolute insolvency concerning them and since the circumstances of their business have to be easy to analyse. We therefore consider that entrepreneurs should be offered debt restructuring through a special act designed to fit their situation.</p>
<p>Around 4–6 per cent of all bankruptcies in the EU are ‘dishonest’ – yet in general no distinction is made between honest and dishonest bankruptcies. Legislation that embraces honest entrepreneurs but excludes dishonest entrepreneurs will make the dividing line clearer and may increase acceptance of entrepreneurs who are given a second chance. The new act should therefore only be available to serious entrepreneurs. Debt restructuring should offer serious entrepreneurs a possibility – not a right – to quickly and efficiently tackle their burden of debt and obtain a chance to make a fresh start. It is therefore important that non-serious entrepreneurs are excluded from the new act. To guarantee this, we have made clear demands regarding the debtor’s conduct. Debt restructuring for entrepreneurs will not be granted if the business has been conducted in an irresponsible manner, if the reporting and payment of taxes and fees has been mismanaged to a not inconsiderable extent, if the bookkeeping has been neglected or if the entrepreneur is or has been running the business in a manifestly indefensible way.</p>
<p>As an additional guarantee against abuse of the system, debt restructuring for entrepreneurs will only be granted if reasonable. This assessment is to include the circumstances surrounding the origin of the debts and the importance of debt restructuring for the debtor’s future earning capacity.</p>
<h2>Family members will also be eligible for debt restructuring</h2>
<p>When an entrepreneur becomes over-indebted, it is not unusual for the entrepreneur’s immediate family also to become over-indebted. A spouse or partner may have taken out a loan to save the business or to contribute to the family’s means of support. It is also common for creditors to demand guarantees from family members for granting the entrepreneur credit. A family member can often be granted debt restructuring under the ordinary rules. But if the entrepreneur is given the benefit of debt restructuring with a shorter but tougher payment period, the entrepreneur’s family should also be given the same opportunity. We therefore propose that family members of entrepreneurs be covered by the new act if business debts are concerned. The concept of ‘family members’ must be narrowly defined and only include spouse, partner, child and parent.</p>
<p>Since debt restructuring for entrepreneurs is intended as a possibility aimed at giving serious entrepreneurs a second chance and sending a signal to serious entrepreneurs that the risks of entrepreneurship are manageable, family members can only obtain debt restructuring if the debts stem from a serious enterprise. In other words, non-serious conduct on the part of the entrepreneur will also rub off on blameless family members.</p>
<h2>Debt restructuring for entrepreneurs must be quick and efficient</h2>
<p>We therefore propose a new form of debt restructuring for serious entrepreneurs. This kind of debt restructuring will be a means of partly relieving the entrepreneur of responsibility for debt payment and giving them a second chance. As a result, prospective entrepreneurs will perceive the risks of entrepreneurship as manageable. It is important that debt restructuring has a forward-looking perspective and genuinely contributes to improving the entrepreneur’s prospects of future success.</p>
<h2>Shorter payment period with tougher instalments</h2>
<p>The new form of debt restructuring is primarily intended for active or former entrepreneurs who plan to return to professional life as an entrepreneur. To achieve the purpose of a special form of debt restructuring for entrepreneurs – to enable the entrepreneur to make a fresh start and contribute to economic growth – it is important that the entrepreneur can quickly tackle the burden of debt and that the payment period is short. However, the payment period must not be so short as to undermine respect for contracts entered into. It could be felt to be objectionable if the entrepreneur could be relieved of the liability to pay without having paid anything during the payment period, as can be the case in ordinary debt restructuring. Instead, we propose a relatively short but tough payment period.</p>
<p>We have settled on a payment period of three years, which is in line with the recommendation recently adopted by the European Commission. The payment period in ordinary debt restructuring is five years. The shorter payment period for entrepreneurs is motivated not only by the need to reduce risks for entrepreneurs but also by the fact that entrepreneurs will face considerably tougher terms of payment than under the Debt Relief Act. No paymentfree months should be introduced for entrepreneurs, even if this does happen in ordinary debt restructuring in accordance with the proposal of the 2012 Debt Relief Inquiry. An entrepreneur whose debts are to be restructured must pay the creditors at least SEK 5 000 per quarter. The entrepreneur must also actively present her or his debt situation and earning potential, and show how the enterprise has been run, whereas in ordinary debt restructuring the Swedish Enforcement Authority takes care of parts of the investigation.</p>
<p>To further speed up the process of writing off the debtor’s debts and create an efficient debt restructuring procedure, we propose, like the 2012 Debt Relief Inquiry, that the debtor begin making payments as soon as the initiating decision has been made.</p>
<h2>Debt restructuring for entrepreneurs can be granted even though the debtor’s financial circumstances are uncertain</h2>
<p>One of the reasons why it is difficult for entrepreneurs to obtain debt restructuring under current regulations is that the entrepreneur’s future income is often uncertain. The ‘absolute insolvency’ requirement will not be changed relative to what applies to other natural persons. However, in the new form of debt restructuring, the Swedish Enforcement Authority must estimate the entrepreneur’s future income, partly so as to determine whether the entrepreneur is absolutely insolvent and partly to determine her or his capacity to pay. Here, a guideline may facilitate assessment. If the debtor would be unable to pay her or his debts within the foreseeable future even if her or his income were to double, it is reasonable to regard the debtor as absolutely insolvent. And where the ability to pay is concerned, great weight should be given to the debtor’s own assessment. If the entrepreneur judges that her or his new business operation will permit income withdrawals that enable the entrepreneur to keep up with the payments envisaged in the payment plan, this should be accepted unless it appears to be an obvious misjudgement. If the entrepreneur is serious and otherwise fulfils the requirements for debt restructuring, the entrepreneur should therefore be given a chance to try to become free of debt even if the entrepreneur’s future income is not entirely certain.</p>
<h2>Flexible payment intervals</h2>
<p>In ordinary debt restructuring, the debtor normally pays a certain amount every month. Active entrepreneurs often have irregular incomes. Terms of payment differ in different sectors and an entrepreneur who has 90-day terms of payment will have difficulty managing monthly payments, particularly during a start-up phase. The general rule should therefore be that the debtor is to pay on a quarterly basis, but both monthly and twice-yearly payments should also be possible where appropriate.</p>
<h2>From bankruptcy to debt restructuring for entrepreneurs</h2>
<p>Most entrepreneurs who will apply for debt restructuring for entrepreneurs will either personally have been declared bankrupt or have run their business operation in a company that has been declared bankrupt. To reach these entrepreneurs, the court in the bankruptcy case should inform the debtor, or its representative if the debtor is a legal person, about the possibility of applying for debt restructuring. The inventory of the estate in bankruptcy and the receiver’s statements concerning the entrepreneur’s conduct can have a considerable influence on the assessment of the debt restructuring case. However, prior bankruptcy should not be required to qualify for debt restructuring for entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>The institution of bankruptcy will continue to take precedence over the institution of debt restructuring, which means, among other things, that debt restructuring for entrepreneurs cannot be initiated during the debtor’s personal bankruptcy. To ensure that debt restructuring for entrepreneurs is only available to honest and responsible entrepreneurs, the debtor should not be protected from bankruptcy before the decision on debt restructuring for entrepreneurs has become final and non-appealable. This will give the debtor’s creditors the possibility of having the debtor declared bankrupt if there is any suspicion that recoverable transactions or other forms of unfair conduct have occurred, or if a bankruptcy could yield a more favourable outcome for the creditors for some other reason.</p>
<h2>Debt restructuring for entrepreneurs should be possible without bankruptcy</h2>
<p>Even if a business operation is usually wound up by bankruptcy, a business can be wound up in other ways as well, for example by deregistering an unincorporated business. To avoid the risk of debt restructuring for entrepreneurs encouraging bankruptcy, entrepreneurs who have wound up their business in some other way than bankruptcy should also come under the regulations.</p>
<p>Debt restructuring for entrepreneurs should also be available to debtors who are running an ongoing business operation. If an active entrepreneur is over-indebted because of old debts (e.g. from having sold real estate at a loss), in the current system he or she is generally prevented from obtaining debt restructuring unless the business is wound up. It is not reasonable to have legislation that forces an entrepreneur to wind up a business that works and is beneficial to society in order to obtain debt restructuring. However, for an active entrepreneur to be granted debt restructuring for entrepreneurs, the business must be sound and function well. The business must therefore be able to pay taxes and other liabilities at the proper time. An entrepreneur who runs a business that is making a loss and that therefore repeatedly incurs new debts should not be covered by the system.</p>
<h2>Debt restructuring can be cancelled or changed</h2>
<p>It goes without saying that the debtor must be able to depend on debt restructuring for entrepreneurs being a permanent decision that cannot be torn up. But as pointed out, debt restructuring for entrepreneurs is intended as a possibility – not a right – for serious entrepreneurs. If the entrepreneur has engaged in irresponsible conduct, e.g. by giving incorrect information, and should therefore never have obtained the benefit of debt restructuring, the decision should normally be cancelled. The same applies if the entrepreneur does not follow the payment plan.</p>
<p>If the debtor’s financial position substantially improves during the payment period, the creditors should benefit from this improvement. The amount that the debtor is to pay the creditors should then be raised. If the probably very unusual situation should arise that the debtor goes from being over-indebted to being rich within a few years, the debt restructuring can be cancelled with the effect that the debtor once again becomes fully liable for all her or his debts. This requires the debtor’s financial position to have improved to such an extent that he or she can pay all the debts without foregoing a reasonable standard of living. Another condition is that a creditor applies for this within five years of the decision to initiate debt restructuring for entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>If the debtor’s financial position deteriorates, in exceptional cases the debtor can apply for a change in the payment plan for the later part of the payment period.</p>
<h2>Economic consequences of the proposals Will there be a change in payment behaviour?</h2>
<p>It is important that we keep a high standard of payment behaviour in both business and private life. Business relations and trade benefit if actors are confident that contracts will be kept and invoices paid, and this is also crucial to the smooth functioning of society and a high degree of social trust. But trust must be mutual. When a serious entrepreneur, through no fault of their own, has become unable to pay their debts, the creditors and society should be able to share the responsibility with the debtor. Since debt restructuring for entrepreneurs will only be available to responsible and serious entrepreneurs, our assessment is that the legislation will not adversely affect the general standard of payment behaviour.</p>
<h2>Will there be a change in the granting of credit?</h2>
<p>One argument for the previous restrictive approach to offering entrepreneurs the possibility of debt restructuring was the risk of negative consequences for the granting of credit. The new form of debt restructuring, however, will only apply to a limited circle of debtors. Most of these debtors will have gone through bankruptcy procedures, either in person or through their business, and for this reason their debts must in any case appear highly uncertain from the lender’s perspective, at least in the short term. The actual financial consequences for creditors should therefore be extremely limited. In addition, part of the personal risk-taking remains with the entrepreneur due to the requirement that the entrepreneur must always pay a certain proportion of her or his debts. In light of this, there appears to be little risk that the new form of debt restructuring will lead to rising credit costs and poorer access to credit. This conclusion is supported by the assessment that Professor Lars Silver, Umeå University, and Associate Professor Björn Berggren, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, have arrived at in their analysis of the proposal’s consequences for the granting of credit.</p>
<h2>Proposal will benefit economic growth</h2>
<p>A number of empirical studies have focused on the importance of new enterprises for economic growth. They can be summed up by stating that the majority of the studies conducted show a positive link between new enterprises and economic growth.</p>
<p>The Swedish Agency for Growth Policy Analysis has been commissioned by the Inquiry to analyse the consequences of the proposal for new enterprises and growth and has concluded that relaxing the insolvency legislation will probably favour ‘better’, not just more, entrepreneurship. To put it another way, the proposal can be expected to benefit entrepreneurship that has an explicit desire to grow and that in the longer perspective will create jobs and contribute to increased economic growth.</p>
<h2>A narrow field of application with great symbolic value</h2>
<p>Based on the experiences of the Danish system, we estimate that approximately 800 over-indebted entrepreneurs per year will be granted debt restructuring for entrepreneurs. Even if this figure is no more than a rough estimate, the regulations will therefore have a narrow field of application. At the same time, the regulations may be absolutely vital to the individual entrepreneurs who qualify, as they will offer them a chance of a fresh start after a failed business venture. Moreover, the act will have considerable symbolic value by sending a signal to prospective and existing entrepreneurs that the risk involved in serious business ventures is being reduced, and this in turn will have a positive impact on growth. Regulations that open the way to a quick and efficient writing off of debts for serious entrepreneurs plug a gap in the Swedish system of insolvency law and are also in line with the current EU work on insolvency law.</p>

<h2>PRODUCTIVE ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND INSOLVENCY LEGISLATURE: A CROSS­COUNTRY STUDY</h2>
<p>Karl Wennberg,  Stockholm School of Economics © 2014 the authors and Swedish Agency for Growth Policy Analysis</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>A sizable literature in political economics and law has focused on the importance of a "fresh start" for entrepreneurs who finds themselves in financial insolvency (eg, Hallinan, 1986). Encouraging personal risk taking and entrepreneurship are imperative requirements for modern economic systems since the most productive types of entrepreneurship often involves joint ownership and labor input by the founder­entrepreneur(s) (Kihlstrom, & Laffont, 1979; Gennaioli et al., 2013).</p>
<p>International authority in the field of insolvency law and political economy, prof. Michelle White, summarize the state of current academic knowledge as ”Our research shows that potential entrepreneurs are strongly affected by changes in the risk of bankruptcy” (White 2001, p. 19–20). As noted in a recent issue of The Economist (2010: 68), which addressed public policy attempts to promote entrepreneurship and economic growth in the midst of the global financial crisis: “Making it easier to close a business may not sound as inviting as announcing yet another ‘enterprise fund’ or ‘innovation initiative’, but it is more vital to reviving the world's moribund economy. In the short run, enlightened bankruptcy laws reduce unemployment by keeping viable companies alive. In the long run they boost rates of entrepreneurship. The best way to get more people to start businesses is to make it easier to wind them up.” (Economist, 2010, p. 68).</p>
<p>On the other hand, too lenient insolvency laws imply a risk that creditors will react negatively by raising the costs of interest and/or access to financing of small firms, which may negatively affect small firms’ access to credit. Consequently, growth­ friendly insolvency legislature implies a balance between not exclusively favour the creditors of small firms (Gratzer & Sjögren, 1999) and at the same time not encourage ‘excess entry’ of unproductive entrepreneurs (Camerer & Lovallo, 1999).</p>
<p>The overall goals of insolvency legislation are multifold: on the one hand, insolvency rules and legislation is meant to protect asset owners’ claims to assets that are produced or controlled by firm (e.g. shareholders in the firm, customers, debt holders, tax authorities). Recent reforms of insolvency rules such as the U.S. Chapter 11 legislation or the Swedish 2010 bankruptcy legislation, often strives to weed out bankrupt firms deemed non­productive and where reorganization is not likely to result in a profitable firm, but encourage the reorganization and re­initiation of deemed likely to have the chance to become profitable in the nearby future. The ‘recycling’ of resources from bankruptcies, be it fixed assets in the firm or the human capital of entrepreneurship and employees are imperative for recouping societal investments (Lee et al., 2007; Peng et al., 2010; White, 2001) and for the potential of entrepreneurs to learn from their mistakes (Jenkins et al., 2014; Wennberg et al., 2010).</p>
<p>Not all bankrupt firms are by necessity declared insolvent. A substantial number of Swedish bankruptcies are initiated by the entrepreneur herself, while other entrepreneurs choose to sell off remaining assets, pay their debts and liquidate their firm when facing insolvency, perhaps to avoid a ‘stigma’ of insolvency (Thorburn,</p>
<p>Even if entrepreneurs in a young firm strive to pursue profitability, erratic performance is common: initial high performance can quickly turn into losses or insolvency because young firms generally have few reserves to withstand sudden environmental shifts (Cooper, Gimeno­Gascon, & Woo, 1994). Growing firms imply societal spill overs in terms of new products and services, job creation, and tax payments. Small firms that remain unprofitable, however, imply few or no societal spill overs in terms of low earnings for the entrepreneur, limited job creation and tax payments. From a theoretical perspective, thus, policy makers should balance the encouragement of exit of unprofitable firms with encouraging the growth of profitable businesses.</p>
<p>Whether insolvency laws and regulations are too lenient or too harsh is however an empirical question. With the exception of a few studies showing a positive relationship between ‘forgiving’ bankruptcy procedures and the rate of firm formation (e.g. Armour and Cummings, 2008; Lee et al., 2011), there is a dearth of empirical studies comparing insolvency legislation and productive entrepreneurship  across countries. An exception is the recent quasi­natural experimental study by Eberhart and colleagues (2013). Studying a reform in Japan where changes to bankruptcy laws reduced the consequences of closing a firm, they found that the proportion of firms declaring bankruptcy increased following the reform, especially for firms founded by elite entrepreneurs. Perhaps most important: average new firms’ performance increased as these elite entrepreneurs are more likely to found higher performing firms.</p>
<p>In this memo we provide a new comparative study on the association between insolvency regulations and entrepreneurship using recent high­quality data on 66 countries. Specifically, we use state­of­the art multilevel modelling to investigate the relationship between four different measures of ‘resolving insolvency’ from the</p>
<p>World Bank (2004­2010) and four different measures of entrepreneurship from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM).</p>
<h2>Methods and data</h2>
<p>Our data covers the period from 2004 to 2010. Resolving insolvency data from the World Bank started in 2004 and we have access to GEM­based data until 2010. We first conduct country­level analyses estimating the relationship between country­level measures of resolving insolvency from the World Bank and eight different indicators of entrepreneurship. Second, we conduct individual­level analyses estimating the relationship between the same country­level measures of resolving insolvency and individual’s likelihood of the four types of entrepreneurial activity.</p>
<h2>Country-level Analyses</h2>
<h2>Sample</h2>
<h2>Dependent variables:</h2>
<p> Prevalence rate  of (i) opportunity­driven entrepreneurship, (ii) necessity­ driven entrepreneurship, (iii) innovative entrepreneurship based on new products, and (iv) growth­orientated entrepreneurship. Following standard procedures, all outcomes are defined as the percentage of working­age population (18­64 years old) who has claimed the business mentioned above in the current year of the GEM survey (i.e., number of certain types of entrepreneurship per 100 working­age population, see e.g. Reynolds et al., 2003).</p>
<p>Independent variables: Resolving insolvency measures from the World Bank (2004­2010) and described in detail by e.g. Djankov et al. (2008). We use four different proxies to measure Resolving insolvency. The data describing resolving insolvency for all 66 countries in our study are described in detailed in Appendix 5.  Insolvency Time  refers to the average time (in years) to complete a bankruptcy procedure within a given country. We expect that a shorter time for bankruptcy procedure will be associated with a higher rate of bankruptcy filings as well as higher rates of entrepreneurship.  Insolvency Cost  (% of estate) represents the cost of the bankruptcy proceedings, and includes court fees and government levies; fees of insolvency administrators, auctioneers, assessors and lawyers; and all other fees and costs. As mentioned in the parenthesis, it is recorded as a percentage of the value of the debtor’s estate.  Recovery rate  calculates how many cents on the dollar claimants (creditors, tax authorities, and employees) recover from an insolvent firm. In other papers this variable is called ‘Fresh start’ (Lee et al., 2011).  Alternative measure of Resolving Insolvency:  Distance to frontier  (DTF) shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier”, which is the highest performance observed of each of the indicators across all economies measured in Doing Business since the inclusion of the indicator (Hölzl & Friesenbichler, 2010). An economy’s distance to frontier is reflected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the frontier. (E.g., a score of 75 in DB 2013 means an economy was 25 percentage points away from the frontier constructed from the best performances across all economies and across time. A score of 80 in DB 2014 would indicate the economy is improving.)</p>
<h2>Control variables</h2>
<p> OECD  country dummy variable took value 1 if yes.  GDP per capita  adjusted for purchasing power parity.  GDP growth rate  Interest rate  is the lending interest rate adjusted for inflation as measured by the GDP deflator.  Distance to Frontier­starting a business</p>
<h2>Analyses</h2>
<p>Random effect panel regression (GLS) with standard errors clustered on countries. All 66 countries are included for each of the years 2004­2010. Descriptive data and correlations pooled for all years in the study are provided in Appendix 6.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Overall, we find relatively strong by somewhat mixed results on the insolvency legislation – entrepreneurship association in countries. In each of the four country­ level estimates obtained we find that the four entrepreneurship measures (opportunity­ driven, necessity­driven, innovative, and growth­orientated entrepreneurship) are affected by at least two, but often two or three, of the four World Bank insolvency legislation measures.</p>
<p>For Opportunity­driven Entrepreneurship , we find somewhat differing effects of the four of the World Bank insolvency legislation measures. First, we find that insolvency time  is negatively associated with the rates of Opportunity­driven Entrepreneurship among developing nations, but not among OECD countries. Second and conversely, we found that insolvency cost  (% of estate) is negatively associated with the rates of Opportunity­driven Entrepreneurship among OECD countries, but not among developing nations. These effects are described in detailed in Appendix 1.</p>
<p>For Necessity­driven Entrepreneurship , we find as expected much weaker effects of the four the World Bank insolvency legislation measures, compared to Opportunity­ driven Entrepreneurship. Insolvency cost  (% of estate) is negatively associated with country­level rate rates of Necessity­driven Entrepreneurship among OECD countries, but not among developing countries. The remaining three World Bank insolvency legislation measures do not exhibit any noticeable effect. These effects are described in detailed in Appendix 2.</p>
<p>Also for  Innovative Entrepreneurship based on new products , we find rather weak effects of the four the World Bank insolvency legislation measures. The only significant measure is  insolvency time (year) which negatively associated with country­level rates of Innovative Entrepreneurship based on new products among developing nations, but not among OECD countries. These effects are described in detailed in Appendix 3.</p>
<p>For Growth­Orientated Entrepreneurship , we two apparent effects: First,  insolvency recovery rate (cents on the dollar) is negatively associated with country­level rates of established growth­orientated entrepreneurs. Second, our measure  Distance to Frontier is negatively associated with country­level rates of established growth­ orientated entrepreneurs. These effects are described in detailed in Appendix 4.</p>
<h2>Discussion and Conclusion</h2>
<p>The  Flash Eurobarometer Entrepreneurship Survey (European Commission, 2004) suggests that the risk of personal bankruptcy is one of the most important reasons for individuals not to engage in entrepreneurship. However, the perceived risk of bankruptcy differs significantly across nations, with Sweden as an important outlier where the perceived risk of bankruptcy is highest among all the surveyed nations (OECD, 2007).</p>
<p>In this memo we presented a comparative study on the association between insolvency regulations and entrepreneurship in 66 countries. We first conducted a traditional cross­country analysis of the relationship between four different measures of ‘resolving insolvency’ from the World Bank (2004­2010) and four different measures of entrepreneurship rates  from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM). Our analyses show that reducing the “barriers to failure” may indeed stimulate opportunity­driven, high­growth, and innovative entrepreneurship. However, the effects of our four World Bank insolvency legislation measures differ across estimates obtained. All the three World Bank measures insolvency time, insolvency cost (% of estate) and recovery rate are negatively related to opportunity­ driven, high­growth, and innovative entrepreneurship, but their relative salience differ for these three proxies of high­potential entrepreneurship. Insolvency cost is also negatively associated with necessity­driven entrepreneurship, generally considered a less important measure of entrepreneurship in OECD countries.</p>
<p>Our alternative measure of Resolving Insolvency – the country’s level of distance to the frontier  of entrepreneurship as measured in GEM data, is related only to growth oriented entrepreneurship. These findings suggest that insolvency legislature is indeed related to the level of entrepreneurship in a country, especially opportunity­driven, high­growth, and innovative entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>Our country­level analyses suggest that reducing the “barriers to failure” can stimulate opportunity­driven, high­growth, and innovative entrepreneurship. These findings supports and extends the quasi­natural experimental study by Eberhart and colleagues (2013) in Japan by suggesting that more forgiving insolvency rules and regulations do in fact encourage ‘better’ not just ‘more’ entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>Overall, the analyses in this memo provide food for thought for authorities to consider balanced insolvency laws and regulations that take the societal costs of entrepreneurial failure into account. Given the costs and benefits of alternative changes in rules and regulations related to entrepreneurship, considering more moderate insolvency rules and regulations do in fact encourage ‘better’ not just ‘more’ entrepreneurship.</p>
<h2>Validation Estimations: Individual-level Analyses</h2>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>Estimates on the country level may masks what goes on at the individual level, where effects of country­level institutions (such as insolvency legislature) can be ‘averaged out’ or biased. In other words, using country­level predictors to predict country­level aggregates of individual behaviors masks the effect of individual­level attributes on behaviors, called ‘the individualistic fallacy’ in the literature (Seligson, 2002: 273).</p>
<p>Individuals can behave entrepreneurially, but it is far less obvious what the notion of an “entrepreneurial country” means (Acs, Autio, & Szerb, 2012). A multilevel statistical design helps avoid this fallacy by allowing the simultaneous consideration of country­level and individual­level factors in entrepreneurial behaviors. To validate the country­level results obtained and further scrutinize the relationship between insolvency legislature and entrepreneurship we therefore use state­of­the art multilevel modelling to investigate the relationship between four different measures of ‘resolving insolvency’ from the World Bank and the four comparable individual­ level measures of entrepreneurship from GEM.</p>
<h2>Sample</h2>
<p>We have 321,475 working­age populations from 30 OECD countries in this analysis.</p>
<h2>Dependent variables</h2>
<p> Opportunity­driven entrepreneurs  are entrepreneurs taking advantage of a business opportunity  Necessity­driven entrepreneurs  are entrepreneurs having no better choices for work other than the current business.  Innovative entrepreneurs ­new product  are entrepreneurs introducing new product (product is new to all or some customers).  Growth­orientated entrepreneurs  are entrepreneurs expecting high job (20+) growth in 5 five years</p>
<p>Independent variables:  Same four resolving insolvency measures from the World Bank (2004­2010) as defined in the individual­level study.</p>
<h2>Control variables:</h2>
<p>Age  of an individual was measured in years.</p>
<p>Gender  took the value 1 for females and 0 for males.</p>
<p>Education  took the values 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 for individuals received no education, primary education, secondary degree, post­secondary, and graduate education respectively.</p>
<p>Household income  took values of 1, 2, and 3 for lowest, middle, and highest income tiers in the population respectively.</p>
<p>Fear of failure  indicated whether fear of failure would prevent the individual from setting up a business (1=yes).</p>
<p>Familiarity ties with entrepreneurs  indicated whether the individual knew other persons who had started a business in the past 2 years (1=yes).</p>
<p>Entrepreneurial knowledge and skills  indicated the individual perceived the required skills and knowledge to start a new business (1=yes).</p>
<h2>Analyses</h2>
<p> Multilevel logit regressions for opportunity­driven and necessity­driven entrepreneurship (with nascent entrepreneurship as the baseline model). This provides an estimate of the  relative likelihood  of engaging in either opportunity­driven or necessity­driven entrepreneurship, given specific levels of insolvency procedures in a given country.  Heckman two stage regressions with probit model at the first stage and multilevel logit models at the second stage for innovative and growth­oriented entrepreneurship. This provides an estimate of the  relative likelihood  of engaging in innovative­driven or growth­oriented entrepreneurship, respectively, given specific levels of insolvency procedures in a given country.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The individual­level estimates supports those obtained in the country­level regressions, but adds further detailed by focusing the multi­level effects whereby legal regulations in countries’ affects individual entrepreneurs likelihood to engage in any type of entrepreneurship. In each of the four individual­level estimates obtained we find that the four entrepreneurship measures (opportunity­driven, necessity­driven, innovative, and growth­orientated entrepreneurship) are affected by at least tw of the four World Bank insolvency legislation measures.</p>
<p>For Opportunity­driven Entrepreneurship , we find overall negative effects of two of</p>
<p>World Bank insolvency legislation measures. First, insolvency time  is negatively related to individual’s likelihood of engaging in Opportunity­driven Entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>Specifically, holding all other variables constant at their mean, the marginal effect of a one­unit increase in insolvency cost  decrease the likelihood that an individual will engaging in Opportunity­driven Entrepreneurship by 0,1% (in average terms, 0,2%). We also find that insolvency cost  (% of estate) is strongly negatively associated with the likelihood of engaging in Opportunity­driven Entrepreneurship. Specifically, holding all other variables constant at their mean, the marginal effect of a one­unit increase in insolvency cost  decrease the likelihood that an individual will engaging in</p>
<p>Opportunity­driven Entrepreneurship by 0,702% (in average terms, 1,207%). Given that the majority of variance in individual’s likelihood of engaging in</p>
<p>Entrepreneurship resides at the individual and not the country level of analyses (and thus cannot readily be affected by policy makers, at least not in the short­ and intermediate horizon) this is in fact quite a substantial effect. Our proxy measure Distance to Frontier  is however positively associated with individual’s likelihood of engaging in Opportunity­driven Entrepreneurship. These effects are described in detailed in Appendix 7.</p>
<p>For Necessity­driven Entrepreneurship , we find similar but weaker effects of the three significant World Bank insolvency legislation measures, compared to</p>
<p>Opportunity­driven Entrepreneurship. Insolvency time  is negatively related to individual’s likelihood of engaging in Opportunity­driven Entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>Specifically, holding all other variables constant at their mean, the marginal effect of a one­unit increase in insolvency cost  decrease the likelihood that an individual will engaging in Opportunity­driven Entrepreneurship by 0,1%. We also find that insolvency cost  (% of estate) is strongly negatively associated with the likelihood of engaging in Opportunity­driven Entrepreneurship. Specifically, holding all other variables constant at their mean, the marginal effect of a one­unit increase in insolvency cost  decrease the likelihood that an individual will engaging in</p>
<p>Opportunity­driven Entrepreneurship by 0,2%. Also here our proxy measure Distance to Frontier  is positively associated with individual’s likelihood of engaging in</p>
<p>Opportunity­driven Entrepreneurship. These effects are described in detailed in Appendix 8.</p>
<p>For  Innovative Entrepreneurship based on new products , we find a markedly stronger negative effect of  insolvency time (year) for individual’s likelihood of engaging in</p>
<p>Innovative Entrepreneurship. Specifically, holding all other variables constant at their mean, the marginal effect of a one­unit increase in insolvency cost  decrease the likelihood that an individual will engaging in Innovative Entrepreneurship by 3,356%, a substantial effect. However, the variable insolvency cost  (% of estate) is not statistically significant in its association with the likelihood of engaging in Innovative</p>
<p>Entrepreneurship, affirming the patterns on the country level. Also here our proxy measure Distance to Frontier  is positively associated with individual’s likelihood of engaging in Opportunity­driven Entrepreneurship. These effects are described in detailed in Appendix 9.</p>
<p>For Growth­Orientated Entrepreneurship , we find two somewhat differing effects compared to our first 3 types of entrepreneurship, which mirrors the results obtained on the country level: First, insolvency time  is positively associated with individual­ level rates of established growth­orientated entrepreneurs. Holding all other variables constant at their mean, the marginal effect of a one­unit increase in insolvency cost  increase the likelihood that an individual will engaging in growth­oriented Entrepreneurship by 0,896%. We also find that insolvency cost  is not significantly associated with the likelihood of engaging in growth­oriented Entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>However, our proxy measure Distance to Frontier  is here negatively associated with individual’s likelihood of engaging in Growth­oriented Entrepreneurship, in that a one­unit increase in Distance to Frontier  decrease the likelihood that an individual will engaging in growth­oriented Entrepreneurship by 1,511%. These effects are described in detailed in Appendix 10.</p>
