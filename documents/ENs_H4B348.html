<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>Sweden’s current county boundaries date back, in most cases, hundreds of years. As early as 1957, the Parliamentary Auditors pointed out that the counties no longer appeared to be naturally divided administrative units, and ever since, inquiry after inquiry has indicated that the current county boundaries have become obsolete and that a reform of the regional administrative organisation is needed.</p>
<p>However, in recent decades three major changes to the county boundaries have been implemented. In 1968, the City of Stockholm and Stockholm County were merged into a single county, Stockholm County. In 1997, Kristianstad County and Malmöhus County were merged into Skåne County, and a year later, in 1998, Gothenburg and Bohus County, Älvsborg County and Skaraborg County were merged into Västra Götaland County. Regional reform has thus been implemented in the metropolitan areas. More than half of Sweden’s population live in these counties, while less than half live in 18 other counties.</p>
<p>The county boundaries are administrative boundaries, originally intended to demarcate both national government administration and the activities of the county councils. However, today the county administrative boards are the only national government agencies that use the counties as the basis for their divisions. Most other national government agencies with a regional organisation are divided into between five and eight regions. Some have fewer, others more. If we compare the divisions of national government agencies, we see that they vary, and that, in essence no two are alike. Each agency has divided itself up based on an internal perspective and the conditions pertaining to their own activities, without regard for the effect on regional level implementation of national government administration as a whole.</p>
<p>The regional divisions of national government are thus both asymmetrical and fragmented. The county councils’ two largest areas of activity – health and medical care, and regional growth – are also regionalised to some extent. The county councils cooperate in six health care regions, and each health care region has a coordination board tasked with coordinating highly specialised care within the region, which encompasses several county councils. A significant part of regional growth activities takes place in eight ‘NUTS 2’ regions, each of which distributes funds from the</p>
<p>European Regional Development Fund and the European Social Fund.</p>
<h2>Advantage metropolitan regions</h2>
<p>The significant imbalance in the regional administrative organisation has been advantageous for Stockholm, Skåne and Västra Götaland, in that they have large administrative resources and a knowledge base they can bring to both regional and national discussions on distribution of resources.</p>
<p>By dint of their planning capacity, these counties can therefore produce thorough documentation that is tailored to the decisionmaking processes of agencies such as the Swedish Transport Administration. With good local and regional knowledge and a factual advantage in discussions concerning, for example, the planning of roads and railways, a strong region can convincingly and proactively produce analyses that illustrate why its own proposals are the most appropriate and profitable. There is also a size imbalance in the distribution of national research resources and project funds from the EU. Investigations show that of the research funds from Vinnova, the EU Framework Programme, the Swedish Agency for Economic and Regional Growth and the Swedish Energy Agency distributed in competition between European regions and counties in Sweden, 82 per cent have gone to the metropolitan counties and research environments in Östergötland and Uppsala. Just 18 per cent have gone to the rest of Sweden. Another report on regional development resources shows clearly that the counties that are already strong benefit most.</p>
<p>The proposal we now present is based on our view that it is possible, for the future, to create six strong counties that, with increased global competition and within the framework of European integration, can all contribute to national growth and local welfare. These county councils would also be strong enough to function in a fit-for-purpose regional administrative organisation alongside county administrative boards and national government agencies. Sweden’s regional division is important in terms of the possibilities to create growth, and thus the conditions for equal welfare throughout the country.</p>
<h2>A fit-for-purpose administrative organisation</h2>
<p>The counties of today are no longer the starting point for a significant part of the regional activities of either national government or the county councils, as they were once intended to be. In our assessment, the first step in coordinating national government activities at regional level is to align the regional divisions of certain relevant national government agencies with the new county and county council boundaries. This would lay the foundations for an administrative organisation based on the need for cooperation for development and sustainable growth. We consider that coordinated regional boundaries are most relevant for those national government agencies that:  are particularly important for cooperation on regional development responsibilities and for regional development in the county;  have clear links to the activities of the county councils and municipalities; or  have clear links to the activities of the county administrative boards.</p>
<p>In our final report, we intend to return to the question of which national government agencies should have coordinated regional boundaries. Nonetheless, it can be noted that coordinated regional boundaries are particularly important for agencies in which regional entities set priorities and make decisions on the use of national government funds within the agencies’ budgets. This includes the Swedish Transport Administration, the Swedish Agency for Economic and Regional Growth and the Swedish ESF Council.</p>
<p>However, it is not enough to create uniformity in the regional boundaries of national government agencies. National government activities must also be coordinated at regional level. National government has a vertical silo structure with specialised sectoral agencies. Specialisation and demarcation of areas of activity is necessary in order for the agencies to maintain a high level of expertise and operational effectiveness. But there are also drawbacks to specialisation, as increasing numbers of issues concern several areas of activity. Specialisation can also create difficulties in cooperation with municipalities and regional governments, which have horizontal tasks and cover multiple areas of society. The need for cooperation between different national government agencies in order to enable a holistic analysis, and the need to strike a balance between different sectoral interests, are growing.</p>
<p>County administrative boards are the only national government agencies that, like the municipal sector, have horizontal activities encompassing a range of different areas of activity. County administrative boards are also responsible for coordinating national government activities at regional level, and striking a cross-sectoral balance between national government sectoral interests. In our view, the county administrative boards’ responsibility for coordinating national government activities at regional level should be clarified and reinforced, a point that we intend to revisit in our final report.</p>
<h2>More adequately resourced counties and county councils</h2>
<p>Securing growth throughout the country, and thereby also creating conditions for dynamic rural areas, requires an administrative organisation that enables positive development to a greater extent even outside the metropolitan areas. Several inquiries have pointed to the fact that Sweden must create an administrative organisation that can improve conditions for maintaining and developing globally competitive labour markets, not only in the three metropolitan areas, but also in other areas of the country. This is one of the major growth challenges.</p>
<p>Sweden needs to be divided up in such a manner so as to create more adequately resourced counties and county councils with greater planning capacity, better conditions for intraregional planning, and organisational conditions that can bridge national planning silos.</p>
<p>Our work on boundary-drawing has thus been based on four premises for new boundaries for counties and county councils. These premises are:</p>
<p>Equally strong counties and county councils</p>
<p>We have sought to create counties and county councils that are equally strong. Population size is an important factor, as it determines a county’s tax base and financial capacity to meet the needs and expectations of the population and the challenges of the future.</p>
<p>Capacity to build structures for regional development</p>
<p>The new counties and county councils must have sufficient capacity to be able to build structures for regional development. This means being able to establish, maintain and develop research environments and centres of excellence, distribute resources and make necessary investments.</p>
<p>Ability to take responsibility for the regional health and medical care system, including regional medical care</p>
<p>The new counties and county councils must have the capacity to take full responsibility for the health and medical care system. Even with substantially fewer counties, cooperation will be necessary between medical care authorities and national government.</p>
<p>Take existing cooperation patterns as a starting point</p>
<p>We build further on the cooperation patterns that have emerged in different areas of society. Even though these cooperative constellations are not built on a common identity, they often have a major impact on the possibilities to rally around a common agenda and mobilise development capacity. These cooperation patterns often enjoy support from the population, and can thus create legitimacy for new county boundaries.</p>
<h2>Democracy and legitimacy</h2>
<p>One fundamental requirement of a democratic system of government is that it must be transparent, so that citizens are able to understand where decisions are taken, influence the process and demand accountability of their elected representatives. A complicated and impenetrable system could therefore weaken the legitimacy of regional democracy. Bringing the activities and tasks that are currently decided by indirect political bodies together under a directly elected county council would offer opportunities to strengthen democracy. It would also offer an opportunity to develop cooperation with various stakeholder organisations and civil society.</p>
<h2>Division into six counties</h2>
<p>To utilise the resources of the entire country and create conditions for development and growth throughout the country, we consider that six regions would create development capacity to ensure that growth can take place throughout the country. A division into six counties and county councils would offer opportunities for all parts of the new counties to develop and to benefit from joint development, and to contribute to national growth and local welfare.</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, this is not primarily a matter of merging existing counties and county councils. Just as important as creating adequately resourced counties and county councils is creating a regional administrative organisation in which national government agencies can have the same boundaries as the new counties and county councils, which in turn will further strengthen work on both regional growth and health and medical care.</p>
<p>From a strict labour market perspective, one alternative would have been to invest in the current three strong regions and propose a new regional administrative organisation based on them. We have chosen not to propose such boundaries, which would lead to an even greater regional imbalance. Instead, we propose a strong region between Stockholm and Västra Götaland: a Svealand consisting of Gävleborg, Dalarna, Uppsala, Örebro, Västmanland and Södermanland. Similarly, we propose a strong region between Stockholm and Skåne, consisting of Östergötland and the counties in Småland. In the north of the country, it is proposed that the four northernmost counties be merged. This will achieve sufficient strength for effective regional development in the north, and means that Sweden will be divided into counties and county councils of more equal strength and with real ability to fulfil their duties. This will create the conditions for building regional development structures and more equal conditions to take responsibility for health and medical care.</p>
<h2>Three boundary changes proposed</h2>
<p>The proposal to divide Sweden into six counties and county councils builds on our terms of reference, our basic premises, and our dialogue with political representatives of all counties. According to our terms of reference, our final report must be submitted no later than 31 August 2017 so as to enter into force in 2023. If we find that it is possible to implement one or more boundary changes that could enter into force on 1 January 2019, we must submit an report no later than 30 June 2016.</p>
<p>This report contains such proposals that could enter into force on 1 January 2019. Based on our dialogue with the political representatives of the counties and county councils in question, it is our assessment that there is general acceptance of these changes to the boundaries of these counties. Opinions in these counties vary about both the reform as a whole and the date of entry into force. In some counties there is a broad elected majority in favour of boundary changes, and a strong desire for entry into force in 2019. In some counties there are doubts as to whether changes should enter into force in 2019 or 2023. One aspect mentioned has been the challenges involved in operating effective activities in an organisation that is aware that it will be subject to changes over a long period of time. Many have also pointed to the problems that may arise from activities being led by reorganisation delegates over a long period of time. Our overall assessment is that there is acceptance in the counties in question for boundary changes entering into force in 2019. The proposals we make here were preceded in all of the new counties by discussions and also alternative regional formation proposals. We propose the following three boundary changes, and will revisit the question of the remaining new counties in our final report.</p>
<p>Norrland County</p>
<p>We propose that the four northernmost counties – Västernorrland, Jämtland, Västerbotten and Norrbotten Counties – and their county councils be merged. This will ensure sufficient strength to enable responsibility for health care in the county council and resources to ensure effective regional development efforts. These counties are relatively sparsely populated, and a large geographical area will be necessary to achieve sufficient strength in the new county. In this case, the need for adequate resources has been weighed up against geographical size.</p>
<p>Svealand County</p>
<p>We propose that Svealand County be created from the current Dalarna, Gävleborg, Södermanland, Uppsala, Västmanland and Örebro Counties. Together, they could form a strong cooperation partner for Stockholm County, among others. Cooperation on public transport and transport infrastructure, for example, would benefit from being handled by two parties instead of the current arrangement. This area has long since cooperated on health and medical care in the framework of the somewhat larger UppsalaÖrebro health care region.</p>
<p>Västra Götaland County</p>
<p>We propose that the current Västra Götaland County and Värmland County be merged into a new Västra Götaland County. This would link up the business sector around Lake Vänern and build further on existing cooperation, while also creating positive conditions for joint cooperation with Norway.</p>
<h2>County administrative boards in the proposed counties</h2>
<p>A change of county boundaries also means a change of organisation for the county administrative boards. Fewer county administrative boards also means larger county administrative boards, with responsibility for a larger area and better potential to conduct effective and comparable operations.</p>
<p>The county administrative boards’ role in terms of both regional growth and coordinating national government activities at regional level should be developed.</p>
<p>Each new county administrative board shall be responsible for the county administrative board tasks in the new counties. This means that some tasks that previously fell to other county administrative boards will be transferred to the new county administrative boards as they are formed.</p>
<h2>Entry into force</h2>
<p>The proposed changes to the county boundaries shall enter into force on 1 January 2018. The proposed changes to the county council boundaries shall enter into force on 1 January 2019.</p>
