<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>The Inquiry's Remit</h2>
<p>In the final phase of EU-level negotiations concerning modernisation of the Professional Qualifications Directive, the Government appointed a commission of inquiry to submit proposals on the implementation of the Directive into Swedish law and administration. A review of current legislation would take place to ensure that the Directive is fully implemented and to propose changes that facilitate its application. The aim was to clarify the regulatory framework and obtain a horizontal overview of the legislation. This review would be based on practical experiences from the application. The Inquiry would also analyse how the Professional Qualifications Directive relates to the associated regulations in the Services Directive (2006/123/EC) and propose measures to increase the knowledge of the authorities affected. The amending Directive (2013/55/EU) came into force on 17 January 2014 and must be implemented in the Member States no later than 18 January 2016.</p>
<p>This report is divided into three parts</p>
<p>I. Proposed statutes and background II. Considerations and proposals</p>
<p>III. Impact assessment and comments on the statutes</p>
<h2>Part I Background</h2>
<h2>The Professional Qualifications Directive</h2>
<p>The original Professional Qualifications Directive, adopted in 2005, replaced three general directives and twelve ‘sectoral directives’ relating to individual professions. The legal basis of the Directive is derived from the Treaty's regulations concerning freedom of movement. The Treaty's rules on free movement for workers do not cover employment in the public service; the same limitation thus applies to the Professional Qualifications Directive. According to the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union, this is to be understood as activities that are directly and specifically connected with the exercise of official authority.</p>
<p>The Professional Qualifications Directive has been identified as an important aspect of efforts to boost growth and employment in Europe. The Directive aims to ensure that self-employed and employed persons in the EU are able to exercise the rights granted them by the Treaty to establish themselves, temporarily offer their services or to seek employment in another Member State without needing to come up against national professional regulations that disregard experience and expertise acquired in another country. Member States should thus accept variations that exist in terms of education and professional regulations.</p>
<p>Professionals who are legally established in a regulated profession in their country of origin and wish to move to another country temporarily , e.g. to undertake a professional traineeship or fill a temporary vacancy, are entitled to do so. If the profession is unregulated in the Member State of origin and the individual has also not undergone a regulated education or training, the individual is required to have been professionally active for at least one of the last ten years. In certain cases, the competent authorities in the host country may perform a closer check on whether the individual is competent for the task, that is, when their professional activities might have implications for patient safety or security. The modernised Professional Qualifications Directive provides clarification of the conditions under which a declaration may be required in advance, and when a prior check of the individual's professional qualifications could be undertaken, but also the extent to which competent authorities in the countries concerned should cooperate.</p>
<p>If individuals instead want to establish themselves  in another country, the qualifications will be assessed in accordance with one of the various procedures of the Directive. In three situations, access will be granted automatically, namely i) if the individual is covered by education or training the minimum requirements of which are coordinated through the Directive, ii) if the professional activities are regulated through requirements for professional experience or, according to the revised Directive, iii) if the individual has completed training based on a common framework or has passed a common training test. If none of these systems are applicable, the qualifications will be assessed according to the general system.</p>
<p>Simply put, the general system involves the competent authorities examining in more detail the extent to which foreign qualifications correspond to the requirements to practise the regulated profession. If the qualifications cover substantially different matters from what is required, the authority may decide that individuals must complement their knowledge by imposing compensation measures, either through an aptitude test or an adaptation period. Such compensation measures may only relate to areas of knowledge and expertise that are fundamental to the practice of the profession.</p>
<p>The modernised Professional Qualifications Directive contains a number of clarifications, e.g. concerning checks on language skills. Only in individual cases where there is substantial doubt may authorities decide to check the extent to which an individual's language skills are sufficient to allow them to practice their profession. However, more regular checks may be undertaken in professions with patient safety implications. Nevertheless, checks on language skills may never take place prior to the recognition of professional qualifications.</p>
<p>The modernised Professional Qualifications Directive introduces the opportunity for individuals to apply for a European Professional Card, which, despite its name, is an electronic document rather than a physical card. The European Professional Card, which can be issued both for temporary services and for establishment, aims to make the recognition process smoother, in part by replacing existing advance declaration requirements. As the authorities in the country of origin have primary responsibility for checking that the application is complete and that certificates are authentic, the competent authority in the host country can trust that these checks have taken place and the recognition process can therefore be speeded up. Before it is possible to issue Professional Cards, the Commission must decide which professions the Professional Card will apply to.</p>
<p>The modernised Professional Qualifications Directive contains detailed procedural rules for the authorities' processing of cases within the scope of both the customary system of recognition and the system of European Professional Cards. The modernised Professional Qualifications Directive complements hitherto existing opportunities to exchange information regarding disciplinary action with an obligation to inform all other Member States if an individual has been found to have used falsified documents. This obligation to inform also applies in cases where veterinary surgeons, healthcare professionals or those teaching children (including childcare and early childhood education) have in some respect been restricted in their right to practise their profession. Alerts of this kind, which are sent via the Internal Market Information System (IMI), must be sent within three days of the restriction decision.</p>
<p>Which professions are regulated varies between the different Member States, and there are also differences in regulatory technique. For this reason, the Directive requires Member States to conduct an evaluation process that involves taking an inventory of their respective professional regulations to ensure that restrictions on the free movement of EU citizens are justified and not more far-reaching than is necessary. If Member States make changes to their professional regulations after the Directive's implementation period has expired, they are required to notify the Commission of this. The amending Directive requires greater transparency in several respects, both to facilitate application and to enable individuals to better inform themselves about applicable rules.</p>
<h2>The Services Directive</h2>
<p>The Directive on services in the internal market (2006/123/EC, the Services Directive) was adopted the year after the original Professional Qualifications Directive. The Services Directive aims to facilitate the free movement of service providers in a broad sense, i.e. in addition to those requirements dealing with professional qualifications. Some initial uncertainties arose concerning how the two frameworks were to be applied and how the Services Directive's derogations in favour of the Professional Qualifications Directive would be interpreted. Among other things, it was unclear to what extent the Member States were compelled to evaluate their professional regulations within the scope of the evaluation process prescribed by the Services Directive.</p>
<p>In several respects, the requirements of the two directives have been coordinated, e.g. by enabling all procedures as may be required with reference to the Professional Qualifications Directive to be completed electronically via the point of single contact for services, in the same way as for the Services Directive.</p>
<p>The authorities regulating service activities in Sweden need to take both the Services Directive and the Professional Qualifications Directive into consideration as the two directives are intended to complement each other. In some respects, there are rules in both directives, e.g. concerning the information to which service recipients will have access. If a conflict arises between the two directives, e.g. with regard to the supervision of temporary activities, the Professional Qualifications Directive takes precedence.</p>
<h2>The Swedish education system</h2>
<p>The Swedish education system is decentralised in order to provide the best possible conditions to enable education and training to adapt to changes in society and knowledge. Higher education is provided at 31 state universities and university colleges (including the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences and the Swedish National Defence College) and by 12 private education providers. Legislation stipulates which institutions may be authorised to award degrees, and at which level. It is the responsibility of the universities and university colleges to decide on the detailed content of their study programmes. There are 35 different professional qualifications in the Annex to the Higher Education Ordinance's System of Qualifications, an additional 12 in the Annex to the Ordinance for the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences and one in the Annex to the Ordinance for the Swedish National Defence College. These include study programmes for doctors, nurses, dentists, architects, midwives and veterinary surgeons for which the Professional Qualifications Directive has harmonised the minimum educational requirements. For each professional qualification, the Annexes to the Higher Education Ordinance, the Ordinance for the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences and the Ordinance for the Swedish National Defence College state how many credits the study programme is worth, as well as the qualitative targets and other requirements that each student must achieve to be awarded the qualification. The targets relate to knowledge and understanding, skills and abilities, and judgement and approach. The Professional Qualifications Directive also harmonises the minimum educational requirements with respect to study programmes for specialist doctors and specialist dentists. These study programmes are regulated in Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare's regulations. The Swedish Higher Education Authority is responsible for assuring the quality of the higher education.</p>
<p>If a country that does not regulate a specific profession, regulates its education and training, this makes it easier for professionals to pursue this profession in another country where that profession is regulated. The Directive requires Member States to set out which study programmes are regulated, regardless of whether the programmes are conducted at upper secondary school, at university or university college, or at vocational college. The Swedish vocational college system has nearly 200 education providers and over 600 study programmes.</p>
<h2>Part II Considerations and Proposals</h2>
<h2>Regulated professions in Sweden</h2>
<p>The Inquiry has performed a more detailed analysis of the Directive's scope on the basis of the definition of regulated professions. The definition entails that this scope encompass all professions for which a statute, directly or indirectly, requires the professional to possess certain professional qualifications. The term professional qualifications refers both to evidence of theoretical or factual knowledge and to professional experience. If there is a protected professional title that may only be used by those who hold a particular professional qualification, the profession is always considered to be regulated.</p>
<p>In Sweden, professional regulations have been adapted to the original Professional Qualifications Directive in the following cases:</p>
<p>The Inquiry considers that the profession fire-prevention officer should no longer be covered by the obligations stemming from the Directive because of the activities which are directly and specifically connected with the exercise of official authority. In addition to the above, and based on the Directive's definition of regulated professions, the Inquiry also believes the following professional activities are to be considered to fall within the scope of the Professional Qualifications Directive:</p>
<p>It is worth pointing out that these professional activities should be regarded as regulated because of the requirements the professionals have to meet in terms of professional qualifications. Consequently, this does not relate to new regulations that have been introduced recently. The Inquiry has also made an assessment regarding the professional activities of nature wardens, predator biologists, mast and pole work and work with thermosetting plastics, but has found that these activities are not to be considered regulated, as specific professional qualifications are not required for their pursuit.</p>
<h2>Recognition of professional qualifications</h2>
<p>The Inquiry is of the opinion that the current authority structure should be maintained. Authorities that control access to a given regulated profession should continue to process matters as the competent authority under the Directive. This will enable the authorities to gain a complete picture of professionals in Sweden, regardless of where their qualifications have been obtained. For the professions hitherto considered to be regulated, competent authorities have already been designated under the Professional Qualifications Directive. In addition, the authorities prescribing the requirements with regard to the additional professions should constitute competent authorities. In practice, this means that the following authorities will be competent authorities under the Directive: the Swedish Consumer Agency; the Swedish Estate Agents Inspectorate; the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency; the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare; the County Administrative Board of Stockholm; the Swedish National Board of Housing, Building and Planning; the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority; the Swedish Legal, Financial and Administrative Services Agency; the Swedish National Agency for Education; the Swedish Council for Higher Education; the Swedish Board of Agriculture; the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency; the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority; the Swedish Transport Agency; the Swedish Patent Attorneys Board; the Swedish National Electrical Safety Board and the Swedish Work Environment Authority.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the Swedish Council for Higher Education, which is also an ENIC/NARIC office, should assist the competent authorities in assessing the foreign education of professionals. The competent authorities will remunerate the Swedish Council for Higher Education for the costs associated with this. The final and overall examination of an individual's total professional qualifications will always be the responsibility of the competent authority. The Inquiry proposes to introduce an opportunity for professionals to have their knowledge and expertise assessed by the competent authority even in cases where there is no mandatory prior check of qualifications. This will make it easier for professionals with foreign qualifications to seek employment or allow them to avoid problems that might otherwise arise in the supervision of the professions.</p>
<p>The Swedish Council for Higher Education is the contact point for the Professional Qualifications Directive, a function that the revised Directive renames ‘assistance centre’. The aim of this, among other things, is to further emphasise the authority's role of assisting individuals wishing to make use of the regulatory framework and also to distinguish the assistance centre's role from that of the points of single contact established according to the Services Directive. The Inquiry's assessment is that the Swedish</p>
<p>Council for Higher Education should continue to perform the role of assistance centre. In addition, the Inquiry proposes that the Swedish Council for Higher Education should also take on the role of coordinator of the Directive, currently held by the Ministry of Education and Research. The Inquiry's assessment is that the Council is best placed to carry out the duties of the coordinating role because the tasks particularly concern the practical application of the Directive. Of course, the Government Offices should retain responsibility for work related to policy and, as is customary, act to the extent that may be required in relation to the Commission and other Member States.</p>
<p>The Inquiry also proposes abandoning the hitherto existing method used to implement the original Professional Qualifications Directive, whereby the provisions were introduced in each sectoral statute. To the extent that the Directive contains provisions to be applied in the same way regardless of sector, these will be implemented in a new horizontal Act and Ordinance. The provisions previously introduced in sectoral statutes, which are being replaced by the provisions of the new statutes, will be repealed. However, the sectoral regulation will remain and be adapted to the new Act and Ordinance in those areas where the Directive has paid particular regard to the professional activities concerned.</p>
<p>The proposed Act states that professionals with foreign professional qualifications must be treated the same as those who have Swedish professional qualifications. Recognition of foreign professional qualifications thus grants the right to practice the profession under the same conditions that apply to those who have acquired qualifications in Sweden. The Act will apply both to the selfemployed and employed, but will be applied subordinately in relation to provisions based on European legal instruments other than the Professional Qualifications Directive. The Act will also not cover professions associated with official authority. It is made clear that existing demands for language skills must not be applied in a manner that restricts the right of recognition of professional qualifications or the European Professional Card. Language checks may only be made in individual cases where there is a suspected lack of necessary language skills and, if so, following recognition of the qualifications in the customary manner or by means of a European Professional Card. The Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare may issue regulations concerning more regular checks of language skills for the healthcare professions. The Act also introduces a fundamental obligation to recognise professional traineeships undertaken in another EES-country or Switzerland.</p>
<p>The Act makes clear that professionals who are legally established in another country have the right to provide services on a temporary basis in Sweden. If the profession in question is not regulated in the Member State of establishment, there is a requirement for one year's professional experience or for the professional to have undergone regulated education or training. The Inquiry proposes that the obligation to make an advance declaration to the competent authority should be retained only with respect to security guards and healthcare personnel, where there is also an opportunity to check the qualifications prior to the provision of the service.</p>
<p>The basic prerequisites for having foreign professional qualifications recognised in accordance with the general system will be specified in the new Act. Professionals with such attestation of competence or evidence of formal qualifications as are required in another Member State shall be given access to a regulated profession under the same conditions as if the qualifications had been acquired in Sweden. If the profession is not regulated in the Member State of establishment, a requirement of one year's professional experience or that the professional to have undergone regulated education or training may be imposed. The term formal qualifications also encompasses such qualifications as have been obtained in a third country, but are recognised by a Member State that is also able to certify three years' professional experience. The prerequisites for deciding on compensation measures – in the case of a competent authority being able to identify substantial differences in such training as may be considered essential for practising the profession – or for deciding on partial access are detailed in the new Ordinance on the Recognition of Professional Qualifications. The Ordinance will also state that applicants are to be given the opportunity to choose compensation measure, i.e. adaptation period or aptitude test, unless otherwise prescribed.</p>
<p>The Act also reflects the three systems for automatic recognition contained in the Professional Qualifications Directive, even though the Inquiry does not at present assess there to be any professional regulation that is covered by automatic recognition of professional experience. The Act states that once the Commission has decided on common training principles that cover Sweden, an applicant that has undergone training covered by a common training framework, or has passed a common training test, is to be automatically approved to practise the profession in Sweden under the same conditions as apply if the qualifications had been obtained in Sweden. The only automatic system that is currently applicable means that professionals in the professions of pharmacist, midwife, doctor, nurse, dentist or veterinary surgeon are to be automatically recognised in the cases specified in the regulations of the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare or the Swedish Board of Agriculture. The Patient Safety Ordinance and the Animal Healthcare Ordinance will state that licence applications based on the provisions of automatic recognition are to be processed under the procedural provisions of the new horizontal Ordinance.</p>
<p>The new horizontal Ordinance contains provisions that describe the procedure for recognising professional qualifications when professionals establish themselves in Sweden, regardless of the recognition system applied. The examination of an application for a licence or other evidence of formal qualifications will be divided into two or three steps when the professional has acquired professional qualifications or had them recognised in another Member State. The intention is to make it clear that the scrutiny of professional qualifications will take place separately from any other requirements for practising the profession, e.g. language requirements. A new procedure will be introduced for the examination of professional qualifications that will form the basis for certification or accreditation, to the extent that such a regulatory technique is used for certain professional activities. The first step will only examine whether the professional qualifications are sufficient to be able to grant access to the profession. This examination is to be made in accordance with the procedural provisions of the new Ordinance, inter alia, with respect to deadlines, and concludes with a decision on professional qualifications. An application must be sent in to the competent authority or submitted electronically via the point of single contact.</p>
<p>The new Act and Ordinance introduce provisions that will make it possible to issue European Professional Cards once the Commission has made the necessary decisions, inter alia, with respect to the professions for which European Professional Cards will be issued. Regulatory authorities will be empowered to issue more detailed regulations to the extent necessary for the system to become operational.</p>
<p>The new Act contains explicit powers that allow the Government or the authority appointed by the Government to issue regulations concerning the temporary provision of services, the recognition of professional qualifications, the European Professional Card and language checks for healthcare personnel. The new Ordinance empowers regulatory authorities to issue implementing regulations and regulations on exemptions from the right to choose compensation measure. The Swedish Council for Higher Education is empowered to issue regulations on European Professional Cards regarding unregulated professions in Sweden, common training principles and the issuing of diplomas. The Swedish National Agency for Higher Vocational Education is empowered to issue regulations on the automatic recognition of professional experience. The Swedish National Board of Trade is empowered to issue regulations on the exchange of information via IMI.</p>
<p>A new provision is introduced in the Public Access to Information and Secrecy Act to the effect that secrecy shall apply for information concerning a private party’s financial or personal circumstances relating to a matter under the horizontal Act on professional qualifications, if it can be assumed that disclosure of the information would cause damage or harm to the private party.</p>
<p>Decisions under the new Act and Ordinance may be appealed to an administrative court. If the authority has not made a decision within the time limit specified for the case in question, the applicant may lodge a request with the authority for the matter to be decided. The authority must then make a decision within two weeks on the substance of the case or reject the applicant's request in a specific decision.</p>
<h2>Administrative cooperation and information</h2>
<p>If the recognition system under the Directive is to function, competent authorities will need to cooperate over national borders. The amending Directive now states explicitly that the authorities will use the Internal Market Information System (IMI) for communication among themselves. The Inquiry proposes that the obligation to cooperate with competent authorities and assistance centres in other countries be regulated in the new Ordinance. The Swedish Council for Higher Education will, as far as possible, assist competent authorities and assistance centres in other countries with information concerning professions that are not regulated in Sweden.</p>
<p>The exchange of information on disciplinary action is regulated in the original Professional Qualifications Directive. The Inquiry proposes that the new Ordinance state that the competent authorities are responsible for exchanging information on disciplinary action with competent authorities in other countries. They will also be obliged to verify information coming from an authority in another country regarding professionals with Swedish professional qualifications and provide notification of the measures taken in light of such information.</p>
<p>The amending Directive introduces two new alert mechanisms; one concerning falsified documents and one concerning professionals who have been restricted in their right to practice regulated healthcare professions, regulated professions involving the teaching of children (including childcare and early childhood education) or as a veterinary surgeon. The Commission will decide how the alert mechanisms will function before these can become operational, and may also govern how the flow of information is to be handled in the Member States. Pending more detailed information from the Commission, the Inquiry proposes a structure for administration of the alert mechanisms nationally. In order to comply with the Directive's requirement that all Member States be alerted within three days of the decision to restrict the right to practise, the Inquiry proposes that these alerts be sent by the Medical Responsibility Board, the Teachers' Disciplinary Board and the Disciplinary Board for Animal Healthcare. All alerts received from other countries will arrive with the Swedish Council for Higher Education, which will then disseminate the information to the relevant authorities in Sweden. With regard to the alert mechanism for falsified certificates, the Inquiry proposes that this should be administered by the Swedish Council for Higher Education. Competent authorities that file a police report concerning an individual who has used falsified certificates in connection with the recognition of professional qualifications must inform the Swedish Council for Higher Education. The Council will also receive alerts about falsified documents from other countries and forward this information to the relevant authorities in Sweden.</p>
<p>The point of single contact for services, established in conjunction with the implementation of the Services Directive, will be used to provide information about regulated professions and regulated education and training. In order for the Swedish Agency for Economic and Regional Growth (Tillväxtverket), which is responsible for the contact point, to discharge the obligations imposed by the modernised Professional Qualifications Directive, the competent authorities are to provide that agency with the necessary information and keep it updated. Responsibility for providing Tillväxtverket with information on regulated education and training will be divided between the Swedish National Agency for Education, with regard to upper secondary schools, the Swedish Council for Higher Education, with regard to universities and university colleges, and the Swedish National Agency for Higher Vocational Education, with regard to vocational colleges. As is already currently the case with respect to the Services Directive, Tillväxtverket will also ensure that all the requirements, procedures and formalities covered by the modernised Professional Qualifications Directive can be completed electronically and remotely via the contact point for services. The Ordinance will state that all information should also be available in English. The Swedish National Board of Trade will continue to retain its role as coordinator for the contact point.</p>
<h2>Measures to support professionals with Swedish professional qualifications</h2>
<p>To ensure that Swedish study programmes live up to the minimum requirements of the modernised Professional Qualifications Directive, the Inquiry proposes the introduction of a clarification in the Annexes to the Higher Education Ordinance and the Ordinance for the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences to the effect that education providers should design the programmes to comply with the Directive's requirements. To support the work of education providers, the Swedish Council for Higher Education should compile the requirements resulting from the modernised Professional Qualifications Directive and also monitor and provide information on such updates regarding knowledge and skills as may be adopted by the Commission through delegated acts. The modernised Professional Qualifications Directive namely grants the Commission power in several respects to make binding decisions through both implementing acts and delegated acts. Since the very intent of delegated decision-making is the uniform implementation of Union law, it is likely that the Commission intends to make these decisions in the form of regulations. These are not implemented by the Member States, but apply directly.</p>
<p>In order to ensure that those practising professions covered by automatic recognition on the basis of coordinated minimum training requirements, i.e. pharmacists, midwives, doctors, nurses, dentists and veterinary surgeons, will be able to undertake continuous professional development, the Inquiry proposes that the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare and the Swedish Board of Agriculture be empowered to issue regulations on continuous professional development.</p>
<p>In other countries, Swedish professionals can be met with requirements to attach various documents as evidence of their qualifications or education. In light of the fact that individuals should turn to the Swedish assistance centre if they have problems, the Inquiry believes that all certification of Swedish education and training, whether or not this is regulated, should be conducted by the Swedish Council for Higher Education. The Swedish National Agency for Higher Vocational Education's duty in this regard will therefore be discontinued. However, as regards the certification of professional experience, the Inquiry sees no reason to transfer this activity from the authorised chambers of commerce.</p>
<h2>Reporting obligations and measures to increase knowledge about the Directive</h2>
<p>The modernised Professional Qualifications Directive places requirements on Member States' reporting and continuous provision of information in a number of respects. To ensure that requested information is sent to the Commission in accordance with the Directive's requirements, but also to strengthen the role of the assistance centre and coordinator, the Inquiry proposes that all regular information requirements be discharged by the Swedish Council for Higher Education. To make this effective, the Ordinance will oblige competent authorities to supply the Swedish Council for Higher Education with requested information.</p>
<p>In connection with the reporting of implementing measures to the Commission, the Commission will also be provided with information about how Sweden ensures that professionals such as pharmacists, midwives, doctors, nurses, dentists and veterinary surgeons have the opportunity to undertake continuous professional development. The Commission's database on regulated professions must also be updated by this time, at the very latest.</p>
<p>In order to improve knowledge about the regulatory framework and offer competent authorities a platform to exchange their experiences, the Inquiry proposes the establishment of a Council for the Regulated Professions. The new Ordinance will state that the chair and secretariat should be established at the assistance centre and coordinator, i.e. the Swedish Council for Higher Education. All competent authorities and the Swedish National Board of Trade should be part of the Council.</p>
<h2>Part III Impact Assessment</h2>
<p>The Inquiry's proposals affect individual professionals wishing to pursue activities in both Sweden and other countries and regardless of whether this takes place in the course of employment or selfemployment for a shorter or longer period. For the most part, the areas of activity are already covered by the professional regulation found in sectoral statutes. As the Inquiry has identified additional professional activities that should be considered regulated professions, professionals with foreign qualifications who are part of these professional groups are affected by the Inquiry's proposals. In certain areas of activity, amendments to the Education Act, the Patient Safety Act and the Ordinance on Qualification Requirements for Certain Posts in Healthcare clarify the right to conduct activities on a temporary basis with reference to qualifications acquired in their country of establishment. For other professional groups, estate agents and animal healthcare professionals, the Inquiry proposes the removal of the current requirement to make an advance declaration to the competent authority. However, advance declaration requirements remain for individuals in healthcare professions and for security guards, whose qualifications can also be checked in advance.</p>
<p>The right of professionals, where applicable, to choose compensation measure is clarified, as is the extent to which language skills may be checked. The Inquiry believes that competent authorities must prospectively identify the requirements that are fundamental to the practise of professional activities in Sweden so that individuals may inform themselves about this in advance. The Inquiry also believes it should be clear what is required in terms of certificates for an application to be complete. Competent authorities are already entitled to demand a fee for applications for recognition of foreign professional qualifications to obtain a licence or other evidence of formal qualifications. Individuals' opportunity to protect their own interests in the course of the recognition process is made clear, inter alia, with regard to the right to appeal.</p>
<p>Businesses in the form of self-employed persons are affected in the same way as individuals by the clarifications proposed by the Inquiry. No specific adverse consequences should arise for businesses. The proposals will help to facilitate the availability of relevant labour by recognising expertise acquired in another EU country as equivalent to that which is acquired in Sweden. More efficient processing, inter alia, in the context of the European Professional Card, should contribute to smoother recruitment processes for employers. It should be noted that the competent authorities in Sweden are not always in control of processing times because some exchange of information with competent authorities in other countries may be required in certain cases. Companies that operate as education providers in the field of healthcare or that offer training for veterinary surgeons or architects may be affected by the clarifications proposed by the Inquiry; these clarifications mean that education or training coordinated through the Professional Qualifications Directive must also meet the Directive's requirements.</p>
<p>As regards implications for the public sector, it must first be established that competent authorities are already applying the regulatory framework in accordance with the applicable sectoral statutes. The fact that the regulations are collected together in an overarching, horizontal regulatory framework does not affect the authorities' hitherto existing obligations to recognise foreign professional qualifications. However, this does not apply to those authorities that the Inquiry believes should be appointed as additional competent authorities in light of the fact that certain professional activities may be considered to be regulated. The Inquiry has not been able to identify how many of those currently practising in these professional groups have foreign qualifications; it is thus difficult to assess the extent of the authorities' additional assessment activities. There may be reason to monitor developments in this area and if it becomes clear that the assessment activity cannot be handled with the current funding, it should be considered if fees should be introduced for some of the additional professions. For the majority of existing competent authorities, there is an opportunity to use fees to finance applications for recognition of foreign professional qualifications. Only one existing competent authority has in some cases been prevented from charging fees for the assessment of foreign professional qualifications, namely the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare. The Inquiry can see no reason for this and proposes that the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare also should be permitted to demand a fee for issuing a licence or other evidence of formal qualifications to individuals with both Swedish and foreign professional qualifications.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the competent authorities should compensate the Swedish Council for Higher Education for the costs it incurs when issuing a statement regarding foreign professional qualifications related to education and training. However, at an initial stage, the Swedish Council for Higher Education will need to establish these operations using public funds.</p>
<p>The Inquiry also proposes public funding for the increased administration that the alert system may entail for the Medical Responsibility Board and for the Swedish Agency for Economic and Regional Growth with reference to the additional tasks relating to the point of single contact for services. The Swedish Council for Higher Education should also receive increased appropriation funding in light of the permanent addition of tasks through its role as coordinator and its serving as secretariat for the Council for the Regulated Professions.</p>
<p>It is not possible to foresee the consequences that may arise if the Commission decides to introduce the European Professional Card system, or if the Commission decides on common principles for education and training. Depending on which professionals such decisions end up encompassing, a new analysis may be required.</p>
