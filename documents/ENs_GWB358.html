<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Remit</h2>
<p>My remit is to review and submit proposals concerning responsibility, design and financing of refugee reception and other initiatives for newly arrived refugees and people otherwise in need of protection and their relatives. The review covers the first period after a newly arrived alien has been granted a residence permit. This means that I shall review and submit proposals on the following matters:</p>
<p>• Appropriate division of responsibility between government agencies, municipalities and other actors for reception of refugees and other initiatives for new arrivals.</p>
<p>• Changes in central government compensation for refugee reception and how compensation should be regulated.</p>
<p>• The individual’s means of support for the initial period and whether central government responsibility for support should be introduced or not.</p>
<p>The focus of the proposals is to be on adult new arrivals’ responsibility based on a gender equality perspective. Taken together, the proposals are to strengthen the incentives for municipalities, government agencies and other actors to take measures to ensure a rapid entry into the labour market for the new arrival. In that context the central government compensation is to contribute to effective utilisation of resources in a way that creates clear financial incentives for various actors.</p>
<p>The proposals are also to increase individuals’ incentives and opportunities for self-support in a way that leads to greater freedom of choice for the individual.</p>
<p>The points of departure are that new arrivals as far as possible are to be covered by general policies and that in normal cases support shall not be through livelihood support under the Social Services Act (2001:453). Furthermore, introductory measures shall be on a full-time basis for the period that central government compensation is payable and there shall be clear financial incentives and personal responsibility for new arrivals to quickly establish themselves in the labour market and to learn Swedish.</p>
<p>Further points of departure are that more actors can increase freedom of choice for the individual and contribute to development of measures and that the Swedish Public Employment Service, together with other organisations that provide employment services, should play a prominent role and have a clearer responsibility in the entire process.</p>
<h2>Proposals</h2>
<p>A new law on introduction for certain newly arrived aliens</p>
<p>I propose that a new law be introduced, the act on introduction for certain newly arrived aliens (the introduction act). This means that the Act on introductory compensation for refugees and certain other aliens (1992:1068) will no longer apply. The introduction act will include provisions on the right to introduction and compensation and the purpose, objectives and contents of the introduction. The responsibility and obligations of the Government and the newly arrived alien will also be regulated in the act. A new actor will be introduced – an introduction pilot – whose task will be to safeguard the rights, interests and needs of the new arrival. The act means that more stringent requirements will be made of the new arrival, that the division of responsibility between government agencies, municipalities and other actors will be made clearer and that services for new arrivals will be made more consistent throughout the country.</p>
<p>The target group for introduction will be retained, but limited to people between 18 and 64 years of age. The period for relatives of newly arrived aliens to apply for a residence permit to be covered by the introduction act will be extended from two to six years from the date on which the person he or she has ties to was first received by a municipality.</p>
<p>A new act on the responsibilities of municipalities for settlement of certain new arrivals</p>
<p>I also propose that a new act on the responsibility of municipalities for settlement of certain newly arrived aliens (the settlement of aliens act) be introduced. The responsibility of the municipality will extend to the categories of newly arrived aliens who are covered by the proposed introduction act, though with no age restriction. The proposed settlement of aliens act is primarily based on a voluntary approach, but municipalities that do not reach agreement on a voluntary basis can be ordered to receive a certain number of new arrivals. The Swedish Migration Board is responsible for preparing the settlement of new arrivals and decides, on the basis of material from the county administrative boards and in consultation with the Swedish Public Employment Service, how many new arrivals are to be received in a county. The county administrative boards are responsible for coordination of settlement in the municipalities in the county. This means that the county administrative board, on the basis of material from the Swedish Migration Board, and in consultation with the municipalities, is to agree on and finally determine the number of new arrivals to be received for settlement in each county. If such an agreement cannot be reached on a voluntary basis, the county administrative board will decide the number of new arrivals to be received by each municipality.</p>
<p>The Swedish Migration Board is also responsible, where necessary, for assigning all new arrivals covered by the proposed settlement of aliens act a place in a municipality. Notification of the need for a place in a municipality must have been received by the Swedish Migration Board within six months of the date the residence permit was granted. This naturally applies primarily to those living in their own accommodation. For most people living in the accommodation provided by the Swedish Migration Board it can be assumed that there is a need to be assigned a place, since they in fact do not have their own housing. People living in Migration Board accommodation will continue to be entitled to assistance in the form of housing under the Reception of Asylum Seekers and Others Act (1994:137). The same applies to people living in their own accommodation until a development plan has been prepared and approved, i.e. a maximum of a month after the decision to grant a residence permit has been communicated to the alien. The proposal means that Section 8 of the Reception of Asylum Seekers and Others Act (1994:137) must be amended. This means that the Swedish Migration Board can assign aliens to the places on which the municipalities have agreed and that have been determined by the county administrative board. For the new arrival this means that it is no longer of any consequence if he or she has lived in their own accommodation or in accommodation provided by the Swedish Migration Board during the asylum-seeking period. Hence, for six months from the granting of a residence permit the new arrival can apply to the Swedish Migration Board if he or she wants help to move to another municipality, where conditions for obtaining good housing and a job are perhaps considerably better than in the municipality where he or she first chose to live during the asylumseeking period. The obligation of the Swedish Migration Board to assign new arrivals a place is intended to apply only once. This means that an alien who after being assigned a place by the Swedish Migration Board has moved to a municipality and thereby utilised the right to an assigned place in a municipality will not be able to apply to the Migration Board again for assignment of another place.</p>
<h2>Division of responsibility for introduction</h2>
<p>Central government is responsible for the introduction of new arrivals</p>
<p>The introduction of newly arrived aliens is the responsibility of central government. The main responsibility for introduction is to lie with one government agency, either the Swedish Migration Board or the Swedish Public Employment Service. The report therefore contains two alternative proposals for the responsible government agency. In other respects it is formulated so that it can be applied regardless of which agency, the Swedish Migration Board or the Swedish Public Employment Service, is given the ultimate responsibility for introduction.</p>
<p>Responsibility for the introduction of new arrivals means that the agency responsible is obliged to ensure that an introduction programme is offered and implemented. The agency itself will not implement the introduction programme but is to refer the new arrival to an introduction pilot who will prepare a development plan with the new arrival which is to be approved by the agency. The pilot will be an enterprise and the new arrival is to choose the pilot. The agency will therefore have to set up a free choice system of pilots for new arrivals (a “pilot bank”) under the proposed act on free choice systems (SOU 2008:15). Under the current wording, the free choice systems act is not applicable to government agencies. The act must therefore be amended to make it applicable even when government agencies set up a free choice system.</p>
<p>Under the free choice systems act the agency is to supply interested pilots with contract documents for application to participate in a free choice system. Such documents should contain at least a description of the service or services the pilot will supply, conditions for performance of the services, contract periods, rules for signing the contract, contact information and rules for follow-up and control. The Government or the agency assigned by the Government is to determine the contents of the contract documents. The county administrative board is to supervise the activities of the pilots and in this context monitor the pilots’ application of the proposed introduction act. Responsible agencies will be able and in some cases obliged to bar pilots, for example if a pilot is convicted of certain serious crimes or is declared bankrupt.</p>
<p>Central government is responsible for supporting new arrivals during the introduction period</p>
<p>Central government will be made responsible for supporting new arrivals during the introduction period. This means that central government will normally meet the cost of supporting the individual for a three-year period. In special cases the responsibility can be extended to five years, for example for people in need of longer periods of rehabilitation or care. The municipalities are to receive government grants for the particular purpose of meeting additional costs they may have in connection with a new arrival settling in a municipality. The earmarked government grant is to be payable for three years and follow the individual regardless of where in the country he or she chooses to live. The municipalities are to be able to apply for compensation for specific costs, extraordinary costs and some health care costs. The agency responsible for the introduction of the new arrival must, therefore, also decide on compensation and, in accordance with more detailed regulations issued by the Government, pay compensation to new arrivals, pilots and municipalities. A new ordinance should therefore be introduced.</p>
<p>Central government is responsible for follow-up and evaluation of introduction</p>
<p>The agency responsible is also to follow up and evaluate introduction. A national system of evaluation and follow-up of introduction is to be brought into operation when the proposed introduction act comes into force. Pilots awarded contracts will thereby be subject to an obligation to provide information and to observe confidentiality.</p>
<p>The effect of the proposals is that Chapter 7, Sections 4 and 14 of the Secrecy Act (1980:100) will have to be amended. In cases of central government compensation under the proposed introduction act that do not refer to compensation to an individual, secrecy under Chapter 7, Section 14 of the Secrecy Act will apply with a straight requirement of damage, i.e. a presumption that secrecy does not apply to data concerning an individual’s personal circumstances. On the other hand, in cases concerning central government compensation to individuals, secrecy under the same provision will apply with reverse requirement of damage, i.e. a presumption that secrecy applies to data concerning an individual’s personal circumstances. Social services secrecy under Chapter 7, Section 4 of the Secrecy Act in cases concerning introduction compensation for refugees and certain other aliens will thereby cease to apply.</p>
<p>Further, secrecy will apply with a straight requirement of damage under Chapter 7, Section 14 in the activities of a responsible agency for follow-up and evaluation of the introduction of newly arrived aliens.</p>
<p>The newly arrived alien is responsible for contributing to his or her support</p>
<p>The focus is on the individual and active participation in introduction is required for central government compensation to be payable. New arrivals will be entitled to an introduction pilot. Together with the pilot the new arrival will prepare and set up a development plan. The plan is to be submitted to and approved by the agency responsible for introduction. The development plan will include an introduction programme, to be conducted full time for at least one year and which must at least consist of Swedish for immigrants (SFI), social studies and preparatory measures for entry into working life. A survey of the new arrival’s educational background, previous work experience, educational needs and health must be made in connection with this. The development plan will also include information concerning the start of the introduction programme, timetable, objectives and scope. While preparing the development plan, the new arrival’s choice of place of residence in combination with both working life and rehabilitation activities will be subject to discussion and consideration. The development plan must also address the question of the most appropriate place for the new arrival to live in order to achieve the best possible conditions for rapid establishment in the labour market.</p>
<p>Social studies should be offered in the form of teaching by fully qualified teachers in the compulsory school and upper secondary school systems. The Government should instruct the National Agency for Education to prepare a syllabus in this field. The municipality will be responsible for the course. This means, however, that new legislative proposals must be introduced, most suitably by adding a new chapter to the Education Act (1985:1100). This, however, needs to be studied in more detail.</p>
<p>Introductory compensation</p>
<p>New arrivals who participate in an introduction programme will be entitled to introductory compensation. Introductory compensation is payable when the introduction starts. The introduction will be regarded as having started when a development plan has been prepared and approved by the agency responsible. The proposal means that the Reception of Asylum Seekers and Others Act (1994:137) must be amended so that the right to assistance in the form of housing allowance, daily allowance and special allowance is not applicable to the period when compensation under the proposed introduction act is being paid to the alien.</p>
<p>Introductory compensation is a form of ”salary” for the work and active participation of the new arrival in working life activities in the introduction programme. The introductory compensation is individual, i.e. not dependent on the aggregate income of the household. It will be standardised and is to cover the personal living costs of the new arrival. The introductory compensation can be reduced or stopped, for example if the new arrival is not active and does not attend introduction activities assigned to him or her. Introductory compensation may also be reduced to the extent the new arrival receives benefits under the National Insurance Act (1962:381), such as parental benefit, or if he or she is gainfully employed within the period of the introduction programme.</p>
<p>Housing and child compensation</p>
<p>In addition to the introductory compensation, central government compensation per household and month can be paid for housing (housing compensation) and children (child compensation). The housing compensation includes standardised costs for housing depending on the number of people in the household. Only new arrivals who live in their own accommodation or live in rented accommodation and can present an approved lease or sublease can receive housing compensation. The child compensation includes standardised costs for children depending on the number of children in the family and their age. Spouses must apply for housing and child compensation jointly and must notify the agency responsible who will be the recipient. If no such notification is given the compensation will be paid to the wife. Housing and child compensation will not be payable if the applicant has completed his or her introduction. Nor will housing compensation be payable if either of the spouses is in regular employment. In that case the general systems will take over.</p>
<p>Due to the design of the central government compensation to new arrivals, livelihood support under the Social Services Act (2001:453) will not be possible as an alternative source of support during the period of introduction. New arrivals who receive compensation under the proposed introduction act will not, however, be able to receive double compensation. The principle that shall therefore apply is that no compensation will be paid for any activity or costs that are compensated under another law. The proposal means that an exemption provision must be introduced in the Social Insurance Act (1999:799) so that new arrivals cannot receive housing allowance under the Housing Allowances Act (1993:737) for the period during which housing compensation under the proposed introduction act is being paid.</p>
<p>The Government or agency assigned by the Government may issue regulations concerning the size of the introductory, housing and child compensation. A decision concerning compensation to new arrivals may be appealed to an administrative court. Appeals to the administrative court of appeal require leave to appeal.</p>
<p>New arrivals are obliged to report changed circumstances</p>
<p>New arrivals who have been granted introductory, housing or child compensation are to be obliged to report changes that may affect the right to compensation or the size of compensation. Failure to report such changes may imply an obligation to repay money received. The agency responsible shall claim repayment of amounts paid in excess or without proper cause to an alien.</p>
<p>The right to compensation is affected by whether the new arrival works during the introduction period. The right to compensation ceases when the new arrival has completed the introduction in accordance with the development plan. The period of introduction does not, however, end automatically when the new arrival gets a job, but only when he or she has also completed SFI and social studies in accordance with the development plan.</p>
<p>SFI and social studies allowances</p>
<p>To increase the new arrival’s possibility of choosing Swedish for immigrants (SFI) that supports the development plan objectives, an SFI allowance will be assigned to the new arrival. This means that the money will follow the new arrival and that the new arrival can choose SFI training in another municipality than the municipality of residence, even if the latter does not support the decision. Each municipality will also be obliged to ensure that the aliens covered by the proposed introduction act can start SFI training within one month of submission of an SFI course application to the municipality. The proposal entails an amendment to Chapter 13, Section 3 of the Education Act (1980:1100). New arrivals will also be included in the category of people covered by any SFI bonus.</p>
<p>Corresponding rules for municipalities’ obligation to provide social studies courses and a social studies allowance should be introduced.</p>
<h2>The consequences for other actors of the changed division of responsibility</h2>
<p>Municipalities</p>
<p>The changed division of responsibilities means that municipalities will cease to be responsible for the introduction of new arrivals. The municipalities’ responsibility to support will also more or less cease during the period of introduction. The fact that these responsibilities cease does not, however, necessarily mean less work for the municipalities. This is because the introduction of pilots does not mean that the pilot will take over municipalities’ and other agencies' responsibility for new arrivals within the general sphere of authority of the respective agency or municipality. Hence, for municipalities this means that even in the future they will be the main actors in the life of the new arrival in that they are responsible for new arrivals to the same extent as for other inhabitants of the municipality, for example by providing school, child care and elderly care services. Added to this is the responsibility for providing Swedish language and social studies courses for new arrivals within one month and the responsibility for receiving new arrivals for settlement in the municipality. It is also to be hoped that in their capacity of employers, municipalities will continue to offer new arrivals work experience placements. The main responsibility for arranging work experience placement will, however, lie with the Swedish Public Employment Service.</p>
<p>The municipalities are to receive government grants for three years for the particular purpose of meeting additional costs they may have in connection with a new arrival settling in a municipality. The municipalities, as today, will also be able to apply for compensation for specific costs, extraordinary costs and some health care costs.</p>
<p>For a maximum transition period of one year from the date on which the introduction act comes into force, the agency responsible may assign the municipality the tasks of the pilot. The municipalities must therefore be responsible for a certain continued period for limited introduction activities. The municipalities that conduct such activities will receive central government compensation.</p>
<p>Public Employment Service</p>
<p>The role of the Public Employment Service in the work of introduction is immensely important. The Public Employment Service will be responsible for measures for new arrivals in the labour market area in accordance with the agency’s instructions, appropriation directions and other provisions. The Swedish Public Employment Service should therefore make efforts to ensure that new arrivals, as soon as possible after being granted a residence permit, actually gain access to the activities of the Swedish Public Employment Service. The Public Employment Service should also make efforts to ensure that new arrivals with education and occupational experience that are in demand in the labour market are given the opportunity to obtain validation or assessment of occupational skills. The initial mapping of the new arrival’s skills, needs and future goals which is done by the pilot and the new arrival in the development plan will here constitute a basis for the work of the Swedish Public Employment Service with the new arrival.</p>
<p>The Public Employment Service will also submit estimates of labour requirements in various parts of the country as a basis for settlement of new arrivals. To ensure new arrivals are given priority in the activities of the Public Employment Service, special resources for use in measures for new arrivals during introduction should be specified in the agency’s appropriation directions.</p>
<p>The Public Employment Service should also have the main responsibility for administrating work experience placement for new arrivals. This responsibility should be included in the instructions to the Swedish Public Employment Service.</p>
<p>County administrative board</p>
<p>Apart from the county administrative board’s responsibility for coordination of settlement in the municipalities in the county, as mentioned previously, the county administrative board will also supervise the activities of the pilots. In this context, the county administrative board will monitor the work of the pilots within the framework of the proposed introduction act. The county administrative board is entitled to inspect the activities of the pilots and may obtain the information and have access to the documents and other material necessary for the inspection. If the county administrative board learns of irregularities in the activities of the pilots the board is to inform the Swedish Migration Board/Swedish Public Employment Service.</p>
<p>In addition the county administrative board will promote cooperation between pilots, the Swedish Migration Board, the Swedish Public Employment Service, municipalities, other public agencies and private actors working with introduction of new arrivals and in other respects also ensure that the pilots fulfil their duties effectively.</p>
<p>The county administrative board should also be responsible for allocating central government grants to organisations that work with integration-related issues. The funds are to be regarded as incentive grants and be possible to apply for throughout the year.</p>
<p>Swedish Social Insurance Agency</p>
<p>The Swedish Social Insurance Agency, in accordance with the agency’s instructions, will have an overall responsibility in its area of operations for questions of significance to newly arrived immigrants’ establishment in society, including rehabilitation. To ensure that new arrivals receive priority in the activities of the Swedish Social Insurance Agency, special resources for use in measures for new arrivals during their introduction shall be specified in the agency’s appropriation directions.</p>
<p>County councils</p>
<p>New arrivals must be offered a health check when settling in a municipality.</p>
<p>Primary care will send an invitation to the new arrival to make an appointment. As is the case today, the county council will be able to apply for compensation for certain health care costs, costs of health checks in certain cases and substantial extraordinary costs for health care measures for refugees.</p>
<p>The role of the non-profit sector</p>
<p>The non-profit sector should be invited to a dialogue equivalent to the one concerning cooperation with the values-based organisations in the social area. The dialogue should be restricted to covering the introduction of new arrivals and be specifically focused on labour market and education issues.</p>
<p>Voluntary organisations that participate in the introduction of new arrivals are to be offered project funds administrated by the county administrative board or assignment-based compensation.</p>
<p>Agency responsibility for information</p>
<p>The duty of government agencies to provide service to the public under the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (1986:223) is applicable. Information from government agencies must be readily accessible and possible to understand and take in even for people whose native language is not Swedish or who have a non-Swedish cultural background. The Government should instruct the Swedish Administrative Development Agency (VERVA) to prepare background material for how this should be achieved. The Government should set up a 020 number to support such persons.</p>
<h2>Economic implications</h2>
<p>It is proposed that the responsibility of the municipalities during the introduction period be reduced, which implies reduced costs for municipalities. The net financial change for the municipalities is assumed to be about SEK 420 million for an estimated cohort of 15 000 new arrivals. This change is primarily due to the removal of the municipalities' responsibility for supporting new arrivals. This will have a positive effect on municipal finances since the standard compensation did not fully cover costs.</p>
<p>The cost to the state will increase by just over SEK 1 300 million, since central government will take over the responsibility for supporting new arrivals. The real increase in level of ambition for introduction activities will then be just over SEK 880 million, since SEK 420 million of the cost increase for central government is a transfer of responsibility and resources from the municipalities to central government. The cost increase for central government is part of a necessary rise in the level of ambition in labour market policy for measures for new arrivals, which is estimated to cost about SEK 120 million. It has not been possible for me to judge if this initiative is to be implemented through reprioritisation within current funds in the policy area or if additional funds are necessary.</p>
<h2>Other proposals</h2>
<p>Public services to individuals and companies must be simplified and improved and administrative efficiency must improve. The work carried out by the Forum for strategic services cooperation should continue. The Government will therefore instruct VERVA (the Swedish Administrative Development Agency) to investigate and prepare a proposal for a management strategy for the work of the Government Offices concerning the Government’s management of the agencies involved in integration of new arrivals. An important element of the remit is to develop the management strategy in close cooperation with all responsible entities concerned in the Government Offices and with a clear political mandate. Accordingly, the project could have a state secretary group as steering group.</p>
<p>The Government should instruct relevant actors to map out the current situation so as to identify measures that can make it easier for new arrivals with disabilities to become established in the labour market. This survey should include the time spent in the asylum-seeking process. Actors concerned in the process of establishment should begin cooperation and trial activities aimed at developing working methods, dissemination of knowledge and information. Expertise should also be built up on physical accessibility for new arrivals with special learning difficulties or mental disabilities. For new arrivals who have children with disabilities, information should be produced about opportunities for them to receive support from society.</p>
