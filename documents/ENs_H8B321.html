<p>The report of the inquiry presents how a museum to preserve and pass on the memory of the Holocaust could be established in Sweden.</p>
<p>The establishment of a Holocaust museum in Sweden marks that the Holocaust, is an integral part of Swedish history and that testimonies from Holocaust survivors with a connection to Sweden belong to Sweden’s cultural heritage even though the genocide was not carried out on Swedish ground. The purpose of a museum is to preserve, deepen and develop knowledge about the Holocaust, what happened in Europe during the Second World War and how Sweden acted. The Holocaust is a decisive event in European history, not only for the millions persecuted and murdered, but also for how post-war society has come to view ethics and humanism. The impact of the Holocaust historically as well as how it affects today’s society should be emphasized. The museum should develop research and communicate knowledge and research results on the Holocaust as a historical event and present testimonies from survivors with a connection to Sweden.</p>
<p>The Holocaust should be framed in a broad historical context and the different groups that fell victim to Nazism should be given attention. In addition, Swedish actions in relation to Nazi Germany should be highlighted. Furthermore, the museum should be able to address other historical and contemporary issues related to its field of expertise. This could be done through temporary exhibitions and public events. The museum should also critically discuss the risks of abuse and distortion of the memory of the Holocaust, both in Sweden and internationally, and pay attention to different forms of Holocaust denial and revisionism.</p>
<p>A prerequisite for these activities is that documentation from survivors – stories, testimonies, documents, photographs, artefacts and other material – is preserved and made available for research and</p>
<p>the public at large. This includes documentation of the fate of the victims of Nazism before, during and after the war, when many started a new life in Sweden. It also requires knowledge and documentation of the actions of Sweden and Swedish citizens in relation to Nazism, the Holocaust and the victims of Nazi persecution.</p>
<p>The mission of the museum should be to: promote knowledge of the Holocaust and Sweden’s relation to the Holocaust in a broad historical context, as well as preserve and make available stories from survivors with a connection to Sweden; establish and develop a collection of stories, artefacts and documents as well as research the collection; produce exhibitions and other pedagogical activities; conduct research in collaboration with universities and convey knowledge based on scholarly research within its field of expertise; support regional and local museums, archives and libraries within its field of expertise; cooperate with government agencies and other actors, including organizations within civil society, and pursue international cooperation.</p>
<p>The inquiry has gathered information and knowledge from a wide range of government agencies, organizations and members of the scholarly community in Sweden. Furthermore, the inquiry has consulted international experts, visited Holocaust museums abroad, and arranged an international research conference. The information gathered through all these channels forms the basis for the proposal of the inquiry.</p>
<p>The main proposal advocated by the inquiry is to establish the museum as an independent government agency. A new and separate government agency offers the best conditions for purposefully designed activities based upon the priorities and long-term strategies of the museum. A separate government agency is also the best solution for internal governance and performance review. Furthermore, internationally, Holocaust museums are most often independent institutions, and this has proven to be beneficial for the establishment of educational and research activities connected to the museum.</p>
<p>The government agency should have a governing board with full responsibility, in order to strengthen the independence and legitimacy of the museum.</p>
<p>The inquiry proposes that the government appoints an organizational committee from January 1 st  2021, with the task to prepare and implement the establishment of the new government agency. The</p>
<p>museum should be able to start its activities from January 1 st  2022 and could thereafter expand and evolve during a construction phase. The proposal also entails that some activities regarding information about the Holocaust, and related tasks, currently carried out by the Swedish Living History Forum should be transferred to the new government agency.</p>
<p>As an alternative the inquiry also considers the establishment of the museum in an already existing government agency, e.g. an existing museum, for example the National Swedish Museums of Military History or the National Historical Museums. Both these agencies have museum competence that could be useful in establishing the new museum, especially when it comes to collection, documentation and preservation of artefacts and archival material.</p>
<p>Another option could be to construct the museum as a part of the Living History Forum, that already has the task to organize for example pedagogical activities about the Holocaust. A prerequisite for this model is a re-organization and altered and specified aims for the agency, where museum specific activities should form the basis.</p>
<p>The inquiry has considered the need for resources and premises and proposes the construction of a new building to host the museum. A new building is warranted because it can be designed in a way that facilitates the public activities and contributes to the interest in visiting the museum. The inquiry does not propose any specific location of the museum. However, the inquiry suggests that the government considers locating the museum in a place with historical meaning in this context. It is also important that the museum can establish cooperation with academic institutions, and reach a large audience, not least school pupils. Should the government decide to create the museum within an already existing government agency, the inquiry notes that it is still possible to locate the museum in a city other than the one where the original government agency is located.</p>
<p>The inquiry has mapped possible partners for the museum to cooperate with, both on a national and an international level, and have made an inventory of collections of artefacts and archive material in Sweden of relevance to the museum.</p>
<p>The inquiry proposes that the collection of stories, artefacts and other material from survivors with a connection to Sweden should start as soon as possible considering the age of the few remaining survivors. Therefore, the collecting should commence already during</p>
<p>the initial phase when the organizational committee prepares the establishment of the future museum, in co-operation with a suitable existing museum. In addition, the collecting should be undertaken in cooperation with scholars and organizations from civil society, such as Jewish and Roma organizations.</p>
<p>The new Holocaust museum should also collaborate with the regional museums in Sweden regarding collections, exhibitions and documentation as well as with the Jewish Museum in Stockholm. The inquiry proposes that special funding should be allocated for this collaboration. Additionally, the inquiry proposes that the government should make funds available for the museum to make an inventory of and collect documentation regarding survivors with a Roma background, in cooperation with suitable university institutions and with Roma organizations.</p>
<p>The inquiry stresses that it is vital that the museum has a close connection to research in its field. The inquiry therefore proposes specific funding to initiate collaboration with one or several academic institutions, and that the museum and the academic institutions should co-finance a research center, and that a chair in the field should be established as a part of this collaboration. The Professor holding the chair should be able to serve as the Head of Research at the Museum. In addition, it is of central importance that the museum has an advisory research board.</p>
<p>Finally, the inquiry addresses the economic and other consequences of the proposals. The inquiry estimates the total annual cost of the museum to 63 million SEK, after the preparatory phase, following the main proposal, but less if the museum should be created within an already existing government museum, approximately 54 million SEK. In the case the museum would be created within the Living History Forum, the current funding could form the basis of activities, but additional funding would be required, resulting in, at least, the same total annual cost as the main proposal.</p>
