<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Following the entry into force of the Act on the Protection of Business Secrets (FHL) almost twenty years ago, the conditions for enterprise have changed in several respects. Today, an increasing number of businesses base their operation on information and knowledge rather than on traditional industrial production. Highlevel research and development is being conducted in many new areas that are vital to society, such as information technology and biotechnology. The development of technology has led to information being stored and transferred in completely different ways than previously. International competition has become keener in many areas. These factors have increased the risk of Swedish businesses being exposed to international corporate espionage. Since the Act was passed, Sweden has made international commitments concerning the protection of business secrets. In light of this, the Inquiry has been assigned to review certain issues regarding the protection of business secrets and to consider whether the FHL ought to be amended and adapted to this development in certain respects (Directive 2007:54, see Appendix 1 ).</p>
<h2>Scope</h2>
<p>Our remit</p>
<p>Our remit was to consider whether the scope of the FHL was delimited in a way that was fit for purpose, in which connection special consideration was to be given to the needs of modern businesses. Furthermore, our assignment also included an investigation into whether the Act in this respect presented an impedement for employees complaining about serious maladministration at their places of work.</p>
<p>Definition of the term 'business secret'</p>
<p>The definition of 'business secret' contained in the Act is broad and flexible. It is technology neutral in relation to the means of documentation as regards business secrets that have been documented.</p>
<p>It has been said that research companies find it particularly difficult to protect their business secrets because their ideas and concepts are to a significant extent based on the knowledge of their employees. However, such information as mentioned here is also covered by the definition, provided that the other conditions are satisfied as well. What probably causes particular problems for knowledge-oriented undertakings instead are the difficulties in certain cases of drawing a line between what business secrets comprise and what should instead be classed as an employee's personal skill, experience and knowledge. We consider that an amendment that facilitates such demarcation would entail a restriction on the opportunities for individuals to freely utilise their experience and knowledge and thereby counteract the socioeconomic interest of facilitating the free flow of knowledge. We do not consider such an amendment to be desirable.</p>
<p>We also consider that there is no other reasonable or possible solution than to allow a business operator to decide which information is to be secret and to actually keep it secret. Other preconditions for the FHL being applicable are sufficient to ensure that the Act only protects such information as is, from an objective perspective, worthy of protection.</p>
<p>In summary, we do not consider that there is any cause to propose any amendments to the definition. However, we consider that there is a need to supplement the definition with a new third paragraph. We shall report on this proposal in the next section.</p>
<p>Has the Act been an obstacle?</p>
<p>It is difficult for several reasons to respond to the question of whether the FHL has been an obstacle to employees complaining about and exposing serious maladministration at their own places of work.</p>
<p>We consider that the Act per se  does not as such imply any such obstacle. Instead, the obligations of employees not to disclose any matters concerning the workplace are connected to the duty of loyalty that accompanies an employment relationship. The rules contained in Section 2, first and second paragraphs of the FHL comprise, as regards the kinds of information referred to in the provision, an exception to the employee's duty of confidentiality under a special confidentiality agreement or owing to the general duty of loyalty. This involves such matters that may be suspected of constituting a criminal offence for which imprisonment may be imposed or matters that may be deemed to constitute some other serious maladministration in the business operator's business.</p>
<p>A critical stance has been adopted in certain quarters regarding the impact of the Act on the opportunities of employees to express their views. However, it is difficult to express an opinion on the scale of this criticism or the extent to which it is based on knowledge of the content of the Act in this respect. One aspect of this may be that the consequences of the FHL and the consequences of contractual confidentiality and competition clauses or the general duty of loyalty are not always abundantly clear to the individual.</p>
<p>Currently, the term 'business secret' does not embrace information about a circumstance that constitutes a criminal offence or which may otherwise be unacceptable from a public perspective. In order to clarify the matter, we propose that a new third paragraph be introduced into Section 1 of the FHL, whereby information about a circumstance that constitutes a criminal offence or other serious maladministration will never constitute a 'business secret'.</p>
<p>We also think that there is a need to clarify in the statutory text that the Act does not apply if it would conflict with the provisions on freedom of the press or freedom of expression contained in the Freedom of the Press Act or the Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression. Such a reminder, which should be incorporated in a new paragraph in Section 2 of the FHL, is intended to remind those applying the Act to consider whether the alleged attack is such that it falls within the area protected by the fundamental laws (Constitution).</p>
<h2>Scope of criminal liability</h2>
<p>Our remit</p>
<p>The Inquiry was assigned the task of analysing whether the penal provisions contained in the FHL have been worded in a manner fit for purpose. We were also required to pay particular attention in this context to the issue of whether criminal liability should be extended to also cover a person who, without authorisation, uses or discloses a business secret to which they gained access within the scope of their duties. This remit has also included adopting a position on whether the range of penalties for offences under the Act is appropriate.</p>
<p>Is there any reason to extend criminal liability?</p>
<p>The business operator whose business secrets are attacked may incur considerable losses. Attacks on business secrets (whether to gain access, exploit or pass on information) also involve the distortion of competition to the detriment of society as a whole. Those working within the business operator's business must often have access to business secrets to perform their duties, which may put the business operator into a vulnerable situation. The judgment in the 'Ericsson case' demonstrates deficiencies in the current rules. This case involved, among other things, an employee who had access to business secrets in their work and who disclosed them to another person who in their turn disclosed them to Russian intelligence agents. The prosecution of the employee for participating in grave corporate espionage was rejected, while the person who provided the details to the agents was sentenced to eight years in prison for grave espionage.</p>
<p>The Swedish Criminal Code contains provisions whereby an employee's attack on business secrets, to which they have access in their work, is punishable in certain situations. However, subject to some exceptions, these provisions are not designed with the direct intention of criminalising such an attack, but instead are directed at other kinds of conduct. This means that it can often be difficult to assess whether or not a particular attack on a business secret is punishable under the Swedish Criminal Code. This is obviously not satisfactory for reasons of legal security. Furthermore, the principle of legality prevents the extensive interpretation of penal provisions.</p>
<p>We consider that there is a need to extend criminal responsibility under the FHL so that it also covers certain unauthorised disclosures and the use of business secrets effected by persons with lawful access to the secret; for example, employees.</p>
<p>A new penal provision</p>
<p>We propose an extension of criminal liability to cover a person who has gained access to a business operation's business secrets as a result of having participated in the business operator's business because of employment, an assignment or similar reasons. Besides the business operator's employees, employees from employment agencies, certain consultants, directors and auditors will be covered by the proposed provision.</p>
<p>Persons of the kind referred to here could consequently be punished if they unlawfully disclose or unlawfully use in a business operation a business secret to which they have gained access as a result of such participation in the business operator's business, as referred to above. Attempts and preparation to commit such acts will also be punishable.</p>
<p>In minor cases, liability shall not be imposed for unlawful use or unlawful disclosure of an employer's business secret. For acts committed after the basis for participation in the business operator's business has ceased, liability shall only be imposed if the perpetrator has acted in a particularly disloyal way or if the act is considered to comprise a grave offence. 'Particularly disloyal conduct' refers, for instance, to the perpetrator having prepared the attack during the period of employment, having accepted the employment or assignment, etc. with a view to attack business secrets or having occupied a particular position of trust.</p>
<p>Liability under this provision shall never arise if more than two years have elapsed from the time when the basis for participation in the operation ceased.</p>
<p>The penalty for unlawful disclosure and unlawful use of a business secret should be a fine or imprisonment for a maximum of two years. The penalty for a serious offence should be imprisonment for a minimum of six months and a maximum of six years.</p>
<p>Other proposed amendments to the penal provisions</p>
<p>We propose that Section 4 of the FHL is amended so that those acquiring a business secret from someone who commits an offence under the proposed new penal provision can also be sentenced for the unlawful handling of a business secret.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we propose that a minimum penalty of six months should be introduced into the range of penalties for serious corporate espionage. We do not consider that there is any need for other amendments to the range of penalties.</p>
<h2>Damages</h2>
<p>Our remit</p>
<p>The Inquiry has been assigned the task of deliberating on the provisions of the Act concerning damages, including whether the provisions on employees’ liability to pay damages should be extended to cover agency staff. The review has also covered the issue of the basis for calculating damages as a result of violations of the Act and, in particular, whether it would be better to calculate the damages on the basis of a notional licence charge; that is to say, by applying the model used in the area of intellectual property.</p>
<p>The wording and scope of liability to pay damages</p>
<p>We consider that there is insufficient reason to amend the structure of the provisions on damages so that they are based on the nature of the attack instead of on the attacker's relationship to the business operator. However, there should be certain amendments to the provisions on damages, primarily because of the proposed extension of criminal liability.</p>
<p>According to our proposal, the provision on damages contained in Section 5 of the FHL should be amended so that it also covers anyone who commits an offence under the new penal provision (Section 3 a). We propose that an employee should only be subject to a liability to pay damages under the FHL for negligent acts if the conduct took place during the course of employment. The same rules should also apply to those other people who are also covered by the new penal provision proposed.</p>
<p>We would emphasise that anyone covered by the proposed Section 3 a, although they are not employees of the business operator subject to an attack, provided they are in a situation comparable to that of an employee, should be equated to employees as regards the rules on adjustment of damages. A classic example of this is a person employed by an employment agency.</p>
<p>Through these proposed provisions, which will change the criminal law and the private law on damages, the disclosure of business secrets by directors and auditors will also constitute such an attack under the Act as referred to in Section 8 of the FHL. A recipient who in bad faith uses or discloses a business secret that has been disclosed by a director or an auditor of a limited company will consequently be ordered under Section 8 of the FHL to compensate for the loss incurred.</p>
<p>Calculation of damages</p>
<p>It is neither appropriate nor possible to replace Section 9 of the FHL with a rule prescribing that damages should be calculated with reference to notional reasonable compensation for the use of the business secret. There is much to suggest that the wording of the current statutory provision already makes it possible to calculate damages on the basis of a notional licence charge for the business secret used. However, the wording of Section 9 of the FHL and the statements made in the provision's travaux préparatoires  provide opportunities for also taking other relevant grounds into account when calculating damages. To select just one of these grounds and refer to it expressly in the statutory wording would give the impression that this method should be given priority over other alternative means of calculation. Nor would it, in the opinion of the Inquiry, be an improvement to specify in the statutory wording, in the way proposed for intellectual property laws, certain alternative grounds for calculation. Taking this into account and the fact that Section 9 of the FHL largely appears to have functioned well in practice, we do not consider that there is any reason to make any amendment to this section.</p>
<h2>Securing evidence</h2>
<p>Our remit</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s Terms of Reference in this respect was to adopt a position as regards whether provisions on investigation of evidence should be introduced into the FHL, in which connection we also had to take into account Sweden's international commitments.</p>
<p>Is a measure to secure evidence required in connection with an attack on business secrets?</p>
<p>The TRIPS Agreement means that Sweden has an obligation to provide rapid and effective interim measures to preserve evidence of relevance for attacks on business secrets. The Inquiry considers it doubtful whether this obligation can be deemed to have been completely implemented in current Swedish legislation.</p>
<p>We consider that there is a need to introduce a measure within the FHL for securing evidence. A regulation must maintain high demands for legal security, particularly for those subject to such an investigation.</p>
<p>Rules concerning a new measure for securing evidence should be introduced into the FHL</p>
<p>We propose that rules concerning a new measure for securing evidence are introduced into the FHL. This protective measure should be formulated in a way basically corresponding to the provision on infringement investigations in the case of infringements of intellectual property. The measure, which should be called an 'investigation of evidence', means that, on application, a court can decide that an investigation to search for evidence may be conducted at the premises of a person who may reasonably be assumed to have attacked a business secret under the FHL. Investigation of evidence may only be conducted at the premises of the suspected attacker and consequently not at that of a third party.</p>
<p>A search may be made for objects and documents that may be deemed relevant to the investigation. However, the investigation may not include written documents covered by the 'seizure prohibition' contained in Chapter 27, Section 2 of the Code of Judicial Procedure.</p>
<p>Preconditions for conducting an investigation of evidence</p>
<p>The business operator whose business secret is suspected of being the subject of an unauthorised attack shall be entitled to make an application for an investigation of evidence. Such an application shall be considered by the court.</p>
<p>For a court to grant an application for an investigation of evidence, it is required that there is reasonable cause to assume that someone has attacked a business secret as referred to in the FHL. However, an investigation of evidence may only be granted if the reason for the measure outweighs the inconvenience or any other detriment that the measure would involve for the person adversely affected by it or any other opposing interest. In order for a decision for an investigation of evidence to be issued, the applicant must provide security (collateral) for the damage that the other party may be caused.</p>
<p>A decision for an investigation of evidence must contain details of the purpose of the investigation, the objects and documents that may be searched for and the areas that may be searched. If necessary, the court may also order other enforcement conditions.</p>
<p>The court shall also have the power to issue a decision for an investigation of evidence without any prior questioning of the other party. The precondition for such a decision being issued is that a delay would entail a risk of objects or documents relevant to the investigation of the attack being concealed, destroyed or corrupted.</p>
<p>The Kronofogdemyndigheten (Swedish Enforcement Service) shall be responsible for enforcement</p>
<p>A decision for an investigation of evidence shall be enforced by the Kronofogdemyndigheten (Swedish Enforcement Service). Enforcement shall be effected in accordance with the conditions ordered by the court and certain provisions of the Enforcement Code shall apply. During enforcement, the service may take photographs and make film and sound recordings of such objects for which it may be searching. The service is also entitled to take copies and make extracts of such documents for which it may be searching. The service shall also be able to engage the assistance of experts and may permit the applicant to assist with information when making the investigation. The other party shall be entitled to summon legal counsel.</p>
<p>Request for a certain document to be exempted</p>
<p>We propose that the applicant's opponent should have an opportunity to request that a particular document or other documentation should not be disclosed to the applicant. Such a request may be presented if the other party considers that enforcement has extended to something that should be exempted because disclosure would violate the principle of proportionality, since the document contains sensitive information; for instance, concerning the business secrets of the party investigated or because a written document is subject to the seizure prohibition contained in Chapter 27, Section 2 of the Code of Judicial Procedure. The request should be presented to the Kronofogdemyndigheten (Swedish Enforcement Service), which must immediately seal up the document subject to the request and hand it over to the court that made the decision for the investigation of evidence. The court shall promptly consider whether there is any reason not to disclose the document or the documentation to the applicant.</p>
<h2>Business secrets held by public authorities, etc.</h2>
<p>Our remit</p>
<p>According to our Terms of Reference, the current rules on how authorities are to deal with business secrets allegedly inhibit the propensity of business operators to initiate a consideration of an alleged attack of their business secrets. The Inquiry was required to analyse certain issues in conjunction with this and to deliberate on whether anything can and should be done to rectify any problems observed.</p>
<p>Secrecy and access by parties to information</p>
<p>In our opinion, the provisions on secrecy for private business and operational circumstances mean that judicial secrecy normally applies to business secrets since the disclosure of a business secret must be deemed to entail a substantial loss for the business operator. Secrecy for business secrets also normally applies to other authorities. We have not found any cause to make secrecy for business secrets even more stringent.</p>
<p>Normally, secrecy thus prevails for business secrets in court and at other authorities. Anyone who is not a party to legal proceedings, but who requests access to a document that contains a business secret, should therefore normally have their request rejected. How- ever, a ‘party’ cannot generally be denied access to information in a case or matter. However, when information subject to secrecy is disclosed to a private person, administrative authorities and courts that do not apply the Code of Judicial Procedure may impose conditions restricting the right of the private person to pass the information on or to use it. Anyone breaching such a condition may be sentenced for breaching a duty of confidentiality.</p>
<p>In our opinion, these rules mean that currently there already exist good means for protecting business secrets contained in official documents disclosed to a party at an administrative authority or in an administrative court. For example, this applies to documents that the Swedish Customs Service discloses to a holder of rights in certain cases involving suspicion that goods constitute an infringement of intellectual property rights.</p>
<p>However, we consider that it is not a practicable route to amend the Secrecy Act so that general courts are able to impose conditions in conjunction with a party gaining access to an official document containing a business secret.</p>
<p>A new rule on damages</p>
<p>We consider that the best solution would be to propose that a new rule on damages is introduced into Section 8 of the FHL whereby a person, who intentionally or negligently and without reasonable cause, discloses or uses in business operations a business secret to which access was gained in their capacity as a party to a decision by a court, must pay compensation for any damage that arises through</p>
<p>such conduct. A valid reason for disclosing the information may, for instance, be that it is to be used in the case or other proceedings that gave cause for the decision of the court.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we propose that a supplement is added to Section 8, first paragraph of the FHL so that liability to pay damages may also arise in respect of a person who intentionally or negligently discloses or uses in business operations a business secret that they realise or ought to have realised has been disclosed in violation of an order or condition made under the Secrecy Act.</p>
