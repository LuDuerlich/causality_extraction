<h1>Summary</h1>

<p>The government commission  Vårdens ägarformer – vinst och demokrati (English name: Profit or  Not-for-profit  in the Swedish Health System) provides a basis in this report for discussion on needs and possible forms for a more durable arrangement as to where and under what conditions, private  profit-making  businesses should be able to participate in publicly financed health care and social services. The intention is to clarify needs and make proposals on a possible replacement for the Act (2000:114) that temporarily prohibits county councils from transferring the running of acute hospitals to actors intending to operate them with a view to making a profit.</p>
<p>The chapter  Vården i Sverige – samsyn eller konflikt (Health care in Sweden – a common approach or conflict) contains a description of the development of forms of operation and ownership in Swedish health care and social services during the past decade. An attempt is also made there to evaluate the effect on health care of changes in organisation and the division of responsibility and reforms of the control systems and payments. Health care in Sweden is highly decentralised and national legislation provides considerable scope for county councils and municipalities to find appropriate administrative and organisational forms according to varying prerequisites. Instead of national rules, a common political approach and the fact that health care has mainly been operated in the public sector have been cohesive forces. Both these factors that have held the system together seem to be weakening.</p>
<p>With a view to providing a background and impulses for consideration in Sweden, the section Vårdsystem i andra länder  (Health care systems in other countries) describes the health care systems in Germany, the Netherlands, the U.K, other Nordic countries and in the United States, Canada and New Zealand. These countries have varying forms for financing health care and different traditions as regards ownershhip and operation of hospitals. Countries with financing through compulsory insurance solutions also have equalisation systems to redistribute health care resources according to the needs of different groups.</p>
<p>Countries with a great diversity of private health care providers also have, compared with the situation in Sweden, a stronger central regulation to hold together the large numbers of health care providers. Countries that have tried more market-like organisational forms have in many cases toned down the competition perspective to give prominence instead to planning and collaboration.</p>
<p>In many countries, organisations, trusts or non-profit-making companies own and operate many hospitals and other health care institutions. The chapter Vård utan vinstsyfte – villkor i Sverige (Non profit-making care – conditions in Sweden) contains a discussion on why very few such forms of health care exist in Sweden. It is primarily when the public bodies cannot cope or do not consider that they are suitable to meet new needs for health care or social services that non-profit making organisations, have developed health care activities. The starting point changes radically when county councils and municipalities attempt in different forms to involve private health care providers for various tasks in publicly financed health care and social services.</p>
<p>The same ethical approach  which has served as the basis for priorities and objectives in the health service and social service activities should govern decisions that stipulate the frameworks and conditions for the organisation of health care and its forms of ownership and operation. Decisions of this kind should be guided by the objective of favouring the least favoured. What is fundamental is that human value and the dignity of the individual and her right to health care and a dignified life is associated with the person as an individual  – and not with her skills and ability as an actor . Deliberations on health care exercise everyone’s empathy and ability to disregard self-interest in order instead to see people’s different needs.</p>
<p>It is also important in health care to strike a balance between fairness and liberty as well as between solidarity and subsidiarity. Society as a whole should promote fairness and solidarity although not in such a way as to thrust aside the responsibility and initiatives of individuals and groups. Private initiatives must have the freedom to develop although subsidiarity must not develop into egoism which puts out of action solidarity and the intention of favouring the least favoured.</p>
<p>The chapter  Mångfalden i vården – drifts- och ägarformer (Diversity in health care – forms of operation and ownership) includes a discussion of how the concept of hospital is used in legislation and statutory documents. Operating forms are also described there which can come into question in health care and social services. This section also takes up tendencies to concentration among the private health care companies and the issue of the effect of having a number of care providers on the ability to integrate chains of health care. The ability of county councils and municipalities to plan and co-ordinate health care through different control systems is also discussed.</p>
<p>The section  Vinst i vården och vården som marknad (Profit in health care and the health care as a market) contains a discussion of how different market segments work together in health care and the difficulties of transferring concepts from the market economy to health care. Most countries have in one way or another systems that regulate and restrict the freedom of action of private profitmaking companies in health care. The intention is to safeguard a health care system where resources and initiatives in the first place are distributed according to medical needs and not according to the payment capacity of individuals and groups.</p>
<p>There is a connecting thread from the communal village meetings of the days of yore and the contemporary heated discussions on health care. Health care is a common area of concern for the whole of society. The cohesion of society is reinforced by the common responsibility for health care and social services for those who have been affected by illness or weakness. Therefore, health care is a democratic issue . Democratic influence and rules for preparation and decision-making prior to extensive changes of the organisation, forms of operation and ownership of the health sector are discussed in one section. Questions are also raised about the effects of an increased proportion of private providers of health care and internationalisation of health care services for the ability to exercise democratic control and checks.</p>
<p>In the concluding section of the report, the commission presents its general considerations  and describes alternative models  to safeguard priorities and basic objectives in a system with many types of health care providers. The models are linked to examples from countries which have had care systems with a lot of different companies and organisations, for-profit and not-for-profit, as providers of health care for a long time.</p>
<p>Regulation can take place either by restrictions being imposed in the area where private companies are allowed to operate or by all care providers being subject to the same conditions to be allowed to operate within publicly-financed health care.</p>
<p>There are examples of this first kind of regulation in the Netherlands where the right to run publicly financed hospitals is restricted to non-profit-making companies or organisations. Another restriction can be that profit-making companies are not allowed to operate university hospitals or county hospitals.</p>
<p>Other models to safeguard priorities and justice are regulations that place both public and private care providers under the same conditions.</p>
<p>A model from Canada means that the financial system is clarified. Care providers who take part in publicly financed health care may not accept private finance at the same time.</p>
<p>A model with examples from Germany, among other places, means that the same requirements for insight, inspection and approval of investment decisions and strategies are placed on both public and private care providers. Regulation can also be based on licensing or certification where special requirements can be made on quality, treatment of profit or form of ownership.</p>
<p>The final chapter also contains a discussion of the areas in health care planning, competition and freer choice of health care that provide the best conditions for a balance between fairness and liberty.</p>
<p>The commission is circulating the report informally for comment on its own initiative. Interested parties within and outside the health care sector are invited to submit comments, proposals and points of view for the commission’s continued work and final report.
