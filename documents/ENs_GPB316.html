<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>I Background</h2>
<p>It is difficult to provide an unambiguous explanation of the term alternative medicine. Moreover, definitions vary from country to country owing to cultural and historical differences. Some methods, classified as alternative in Sweden, are more or less officially recognized and established in other parts of the world. Others, used only by non-veterinarians in Sweden, may only be performed by trained veterinarians elsewhere.</p>
<p>The term alternative medicine, as used in relation to animals, might on the basis of definitions used in human medicine, be regarded as meaning the use of one or more treatment methods different from those offered by conventional/established methods. The concept is sometimes used to reflect positive connotations in relation to traditional medicine when it proves to have shortcomings, side effects or other drawbacks.</p>
<p>Changes also take place over the course of time, regarding which treatment methods are classified as alternative. A treatment method considered alternative at one point might later be included among conventional treatment methods if its effects come to be scientifically proven. Acupuncture is a case in point. It was initially regarded as an alternative treatment method, while today scientists also accept its explanatory model.</p>
<p>The term complementary medicine is often used internationally as a synonym for alternative medicine, perhaps primarily when alternative treatment methods are used in human and veterinary medicine. In these cases, the methods used are methods of alternative medicine that have long been part of human medical care, although there are also parallels in veterinary medicine. Physiotherapy and massage are pertinent examples, used as preventive treatments or for rehabilitation in veterinary medicine after diagnosis or treatment.</p>
<p>One might wonder whether such methods should really be classified as alternative medicine even in veterinary medicine. I have chosen to do so for the simple reasons that individuals who have been trained in</p>
<p>alternative medicine also carry out these treatments, and that there is little if any scientific documentation of their clinical effects in veterinary medicine. Such treatment methods are also used to treat diagnoses other than those for which there is a scientific basis, and in contexts other than prevention and/or rehabilitation. Here, too, acupuncture is a pertinent example. In human medicine, acupuncture is a scientifically documented, effect method for treating some kinds of pain, while in traditional Chinese medicine it is used for many other diagnoses as well.</p>
<p>Thus the decision as to whether or not to consider a treatment method as belonging to alternative medicine will depend both on who is doing the treatment and on the existing scientific documentation of the diagnoses in which the treatment method is being used.</p>
<p>Definition</p>
<p>I have chosen to define treatment methods with alternative medicine for animals as methods used to prevent and treat diseases and injuries for which no scientifically recognized effect has yet been established.</p>
<p>Risks</p>
<p>The risks associated with alternative medicine treatment of animals are primarily related to animal welfare, and include:</p>
<p>– The risk of delayed veterinary medicine treatment.</p>
<p>– The risk of erroneous diagnosis and treatment.</p>
<p>– The risk of side effects from alternative medicine treatment</p>
<p>– The risk of side effects from interaction between veterinary medicine pharmaceuticals and alternative medicine preparations.</p>
<p>An additional risk is</p>
<p>– The risk of contagion.</p>
<p>Benefits</p>
<p>Alternative medicine treatments may be beneficial. One prerequisite is that the risks described above are minimized. If it is possible to improve animal well-being, to improve animal health by preventing disease, to facilitate cure of some illnesses, to provide rehabilitation after illness or to increase the contact and interplay between the animal and its owner/caregiver through the use of alternative medicine treatments, then treatment with alternative medicines could be a valuable complement to traditional veterinary medicine.</p>
<p>The fact that some of the methods currently regarded as belonging to conventional veterinary medicine were previously regarded as</p>
<p>treatments in alternative medicine also indicates the importance of maintaining a constant dialogue between representatives of treatment methods with different, apparently irreconcilable explanatory patterns.</p>
<p>Basis</p>
<p>In addition to the committee directives (1998:104) that have determined the boundaries for my work, the core article of which is § 2 in the Animal Welfare Act, which states that animals are to be protected from unnecessary suffering and illness, the following documents have provided a point of departure for my considerations:</p>
<p>1) On 24 August 2000,  EC Council Regulation 1804/1999 1  was enshrined in Swedish law. This regulation contains 27 points, stipulating the terms and conditions governing organic production of agricultural products. The introduction to the regulation states the reasons for using phytotherapeutic and homeopathic products in point 17.</p>
<p>”17. However, when animals become sick or injured, they should be treated immediately by giving preference to phytotherapeutic or homeopathic medicinal products and by limiting to a strict minimum the use of chemically-synthesised allopathic medicinal products in order to guarantee the integrity of organic production for consumers it should be possible to take restrictive measures such as doubling the withdrawal period after use of chemically synthesised allopathic medicinal products:”</p>
<p>This is governed in annex I B point. 5.4.of the regulation:</p>
<p>”5.4. The use of veterinary medicinal products in organic farming shall comply with the following principles:</p>
<p>a) Phytotherapeutic (e.g. plant extracts (excluding antibiotics), essences, etc.), homeopathic products (e.g. plant, animal or mineral substances) and trace elements and products listed in Part C, section 3 of Annex II, shall be used in preference to chemicallysynthesised allopathic veterinary medicinal products or antibiotics, provided that their therapeutic effect is effective for the species of animal, and the condition for which the treatment is intended;</p>
<p>b) If the use of the above products should not prove, or is unlikely to</p>
<p>be, effective in combating illness or injury, and treatment is</p>
<p>essential to avoid suffering or distress to the animal, chemicallysynthesised allopathic veterinary medicinal products or antibiotics may be used under the responsibility of a veterinarian.”</p>
<p>2) The Act on Eligibility to Pursue the Profession of Veterinarian (1994:844), §7 states that a veterinarian is to exercise his duties in accordance with ” scientific knowledge and  well-tried  experience ” (in Swedish: vetenskap och beprövad erfarenhet ). The preparatory documents to the law do not contain any statement by the legislators regarding their definition of this phrase. Some guidance may be taken from other comparable legislation and from the practice of the Veterinary Disciplinary Board.</p>
<p>In a statement from 2000, the Veterinary Disciplinary Board states that in its view it is natural for the understanding of what constitutes scientific knowledge and well-tried experience to change, because the body of scientific knowledge is always growing. For this reason, it is necessary to consider the phrase not only as allowing but even as assuming treatment methods which are initially described as alternatives to conventional practice.</p>
<p>3) In 1995,  The Swedish Board of Agriculture , presented a  report entitled Treatment of Animals with Alternative Medicine (in Swedish:</p>
<p>Alternativmedicinsk behandling av djur ) . Some of the measures proposed in the report were:</p>
<p>a) A prohibition, in principle, against treatment of animals in accordance with the principles of alternative medicine, on the basis of the same argumentation that resulted in the prohibition against treatment of children under the age of eight using the principles of alternative medicine.</p>
<p>b) A requirement that grounds of scientific knowledge and/or  well-tried experience be used as a basis for granting an exception to the prohibition in principle.</p>
<p>c) A requirement that the professional groups carrying out alternative treatments be educated.</p>
<p>d) A requirement that individuals performing treatments based on alternative medicine be certified or registered.</p>
<p>4) Employees working with human health and medical care work in accordance with the Act on professional activities in the area of health and medical care (1998:531) . This personnel category includes individuals who are certified or otherwise entitled to use an occupational title protected by law, individuals working at hospitals</p>
<p>and other health care facilities, assistants to certified professionals, and other groups of people stipulated in special government regulations. Chapter 2 §1 of the Act stipulates that health and medical care personnel ”are to perform their work in accordance with scientific knowledge and well-tried experience.”</p>
<p>Individuals working with human alternative medicine are not required to work in accordance with scientific knowledge and welltried experience. However, there are other restrictions on what these individuals may and may not do. For instance, professional treating others for illness by implementing or prescribing a measure to achieve prevention, cure or may not:</p>
<p>– treat illnesses which must, according to the Communicable Diseases Act be reported to the authorities,</p>
<p>– treat cancer, malignancies, diabetes, epilepsy or other pathological conditions in conjunctions with pregnancy or childbirth,</p>
<p>– provide guidance or instructions in writing without having personally examined, or examine or treat children under the age of eight. (Chapter 4, §2 and §3).</p>
<p>5)  The report of the Swedish government commission on alternative medicine (SOU 1989:60). The report on human alternative medicine proposed, inter alia, that new legislation be put forward in which individuals offering treatments based on alternative medicine should be divided into two categories. One category would be individuals who have basic traditional medical training. There individuals could be registered with the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare, and therefore have the right to market their services under the designation ”registered professional in alternative medicine”. The other category would be individuals with no such educational background. It was also proposed that the Board of Health and Welfare be commissioned to establish the criteria defining basic medical training, on the basis of which the competence of these professionals would be assessed.</p>
<p>The commission also proposed certain restrictions to apply to professionals in alternative medicine, both in relation to certain pathologies and in relation to children (a total prohibition against treatment of children under the age of three, and a requirement of regular contact with a physician and that the physician must be informed about alternative medical treatment of older children). The commission proposed that the treatment age limit for professionals who were not registered and who did not have the required basic training be 15.</p>
<p>None of the proposals put forward by the commission on alternative medicine in the area of health and medical care have been implemented.</p>
<p>Boundaries of the present report</p>
<p>I have concentrated my studies, observations, conclusions and proposals on an effort to achieve a regulatory system for treatment methods using alternative medicine so as to reduce the risk of unnecessary suffering in animals treated using these methods. Another intention has been, wherever possible and meaningful, to pave the way for an attitude encouraging collaboration between the best alternative medicine has to offer and traditional veterinary medicine, to the advantage of both disciplines and of the health of animals.</p>
<p>My ambition has been to be open, if critical, in my stance, in the knowledge that there is no such thing as the ultimate knowledge, and that what is recognized as scientific knowledge and well-tried experience today is always a concept in flux.</p>
<p>II Proposals</p>
<p>1) The prevailing conditions regarding alternative medicine treatment of animals.</p>
<p>Proposal:  The following is to apply to any individual who is not a veterinarian but who offers professional treatment for animals using the methods of alternative medicine. He or she:</p>
<p>1. must have certain approved basic training in medicine regarding animals, legislation on animal welfare and communicable diseases and matters of liability,</p>
<p>2. must have the necessary knowledge to perform the treatment method in question,</p>
<p>3. may only treat a diseased or injured animal in consultation with a veterinarian, after a veterinary examination, diagnosis and treatment instructions</p>
<p>4. must provide written documentation of the treatment of each individual animal.</p>
<p>Treatment intended only to improve the well-being of healthy animals, and that may not be expected to imply risks from the point of view of animal welfare, or that is not otherwise in violation of the applicable legislation may be excepted from item 3 above.</p>
<p>In addition, a person treating an animal with a method belonging to alternative medicine may do so if the treatment method implies no risks for the animal receiving the treatment or for other animals from the point of view of animal welfare.</p>
<p>The national government or an authority authorized by the national government may lay down further stipulations regarding conditions to apply to treatment with alternative medicine.</p>
<p>Considerations:  See section 6.4.1. This proposal requires an amendment to the legislation, see the comments regarding the legislation in Chapter 9.</p>
<p>2) Authorization for individuals using certain alternative medicine treatment methods</p>
<p>Proposal:  In certain cases, it will be possible to grant authorization to certain individuals who, without being veterinarians, perform professional alternative medicine treatment methods on animals.</p>
<p>For this to be possible, the individual in question:</p>
<p>1 must have passed the final examination in the approved basic animal medical training course</p>
<p>2 must have passed the final examination in a training program in an alternative medicine treatment method with documented clinical effects or</p>
<p>3 must have passed approved theoretical and practical tests in the relevant treatment method.</p>
<p>Considerations:  See section 6.4.2.</p>
<p>3) A scientific council for developments in alternative and veterinary medicine</p>
<p>Proposal:  The establishment of a scientific council for developments in alternative and veterinary medicine. This council should be under the supervision of the authority with overall responsibility for animal welfare, which at present is The Swedish Board of Agriculture.</p>
<p>The council is to:</p>
<p>a) assess treatment methods using alternative medicine in terms of effects, risks from the point of view of animal welfare and ethical Observations.</p>
<p>b) evaluate and propose approval criteria for programs in basic medicine and alternative medicine for animals</p>
<p>c) propose approval criteria for theoretical and practical tests for professionals in treatments with alternative medicine who have substantial professional experience</p>
<p>d) promote  co-operation between veterinarians and individuals performing certain treatments with alternative medicine</p>
<p>e) take initiatives with regard to and follow research and development work of particular significance in the field of alternative medicine</p>
<p>f) distribute funding for research in treatment methods using alternative medicine.</p>
<p>The advisory body is to be broad in composition, and include researchers in veterinary medicine, practitioners, and representatives of different disciplines within alternative medicine. When necessary, the council is to be able to co-opt expert advisors.</p>
<p>Considerations : See section 6.4.3.</p>
<p>4) Opportunities, in certain cases, for veterinarians to use treatment methods with alternative medicine</p>
<p>Proposals : In order, inter alia, to promote research and collaboration between veterinarians and professionals in alternative medicine, veterinarians should be given the opportunity, in certain cases, to treat animals using treatment methods with alternative medicine,</p>
<p>After special consideration, the national government or an authority authorized by the government should be able to determine that the scientific council for alternative and veterinary medicine may permit a veterinarian to use a treatment method with alternative medicine.</p>
<p>Considerations : See section 6.4.4. This proposal requires an amendment to the legislation, see the comments regarding the legislation in Chapter 9.</p>
<p>5) Research into treatment methods using alternative medicine</p>
<p>Proposal : Funds should be allocated for research into treatment for animals using alternative medicine.</p>
<p>Considerations : See section 6.4.5.</p>
<p>6) Clarification of articles  10–11 of the Animal Welfare Act</p>
<p>Proposal : The Animal Welfare Act should be clarified so as to clearly state that measures that may only be undertaken by a veterinarian include not only surgical interventions but also injections, drawing blood, and otherwise penetrating the skin or mucous membranes of animals.</p>
<p>It is also proposed that the Act be tightened up in the respect that the services of a veterinarian must be used the moment a risk arises that the intended treatment may cause more than negligible suffering.</p>
<p>Considerations : See section 4.6.6. This proposal requires an amendment to the legislation, see the comments regarding the legislation in Chapter 9.</p>
<p>7) Amendment to the animal welfare regulation</p>
<p>Proposal : If an animal is ill, injured or displaying abnormal behavior, the reason is to be determined immediately, and appropriate measures taken directly unless the illness or injury is so severe as to require that the animal immediately be put to death. If the reason cannot be established or if the measures implemented are not immediately effective, a veterinarian is to be contacted directly.</p>
<p>Considerations:  See section 6.4.7.</p>
