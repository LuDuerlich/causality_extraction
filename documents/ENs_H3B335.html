<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>In January 2014, the Government decided to appoint an Inquiry Chair to analyse the conditions for supporting access to a basic level of commercial services in the sparsely populated areas of the country that are particularly vulnerable and disadvantaged. The remit includes: deciding on the forms of service that may be covered; clarifying how aid could contribute to increased coordination of various forms of service and proposing criteria for receiving aid and for designing and calculating this aid. In this respect, the Inquiry is to clarify the conditions for providing aid under EU state aid rules. Furthermore, the remit includes presenting proposals on the financing of any aid and presenting the necessary legislative proposals.</p>
<p>The Inquiry submitted an interim report on 29 August 2014 that includes a description of the challenges facing the most vulnerable sparsely populated areas and provides an overview of ongoing initiatives.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Parts of the country are characterised by markedly sparse populations and falling population trends. For many years, the number of inhabitants in sparsely populated municipalities has decreased while populations in metropolitan areas have increased.</p>
<p>Many village shops and filling stations in sparsely populated areas are grappling with low turnover and poor profitability. Sparse and falling populations impair the conditions for providing commercial services in sparsely populated areas. In markedly sparsely populated areas there are currently between 300 and 400 village shops. A large proportion of these have a turnover that is too low to be sustainable in the long term. There are also substantial indications that many are on the verge of closure. Village shops and filling stations often serve as agents for stateowned companies. If they close, these services will also disappear if no-one else in the locality is able to take over.</p>
<p>The Swedish Agency for Growth Policy Analysis has developed a model that measures the degree of proximity to urban centres of various sizes. It divides the country into five accessibility classes, including areas with low or very low access to urban centres. The overwhelming part of northern Sweden has low or very low access to urban centres. This is also true of certain areas in central and southern Sweden. The model provides an idea of the base for service provision.</p>
<p>According to the Inquiry, access to daily consumer goods and fuel, as well as chemist, postal and payment services, can be considered as basic commercial services. All people and businesses in the country should have access to a basic level of commercial services. Such a level may be considered to be reached when basic commercial services are so accessible that everyday life functions satisfactorily for people and business.</p>
<h2>Two types of aid to village shops</h2>
<p>The Inquiry proposes the introduction of two types of aid to village shops in a new ordinance. One condition for receiving aid is that the shops are located in particularly vulnerable and disadvantaged areas, which, according to the Inquiry, are described as areas with low or very low access to urban centres, sparsely populated areas directly adjacent to these areas or remote island areas without a permanent link to the mainland.</p>
<p>The aim of the aid is to create favourable conditions for people and businesses in the areas in question to access a basic level of commercial services. The aid will be provided continuously and without any time limit in order to have a sustainable and long term effect.</p>
<p>The first type of aid, aid to daily consumer goods services of general economic interest, will be available to village shops that offer a varied selection of daily consumer goods. The conditions for receiving aid include that the shop’s turnover lies within a certain range and that it keeps certain opening hours. The design of the aid is compatible with Commission Regulation (EU) No 360/2012 of 25 April 2012, i.e. as de minimis aid granted to undertakings providing services of general economic interest.</p>
<p>The second type of aid, aid to village shops that are strategic in terms of service, will be available to the very smallest village shops, i.e. to those with very low turnover. The conditions for receiving aid, apart from maximum turnover requirements, include that the shops are also important for access to basic commercial services other than daily consumer goods and that they keep particular opening hours. The design of the aid is compatible with Commission Regulation (EU) No 1407/2013 of 18 December 2013, i.e. as de minimis aid.</p>
<h2>Support to municipalities that develop local service solutions</h2>
<p>Many sparsely populated municipalities are small and their resources are too limited to enable them to work actively on issues related to commercial services. They may need support in the form of central government grants, but also in the form of the exchange of experience and good practices.</p>
<p>In the proposed Rural Development Programme 2014–2020, the Swedish Agency for Economic and Regional Growth has a special role as national support authority for issues concerning access to local services during the period ending 2020.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the Swedish Agency for Economic and Regional Growth assists regions and country administrative boards in implementing support programmes for sparsely populated municipalities wanting to develop local service solutions. This programme should be targeted at municipalities that are wholly or partially located in areas with low or very low access to urban centres – approximately 80 sparsely populated municipalities.</p>
