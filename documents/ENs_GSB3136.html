<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>District heating has expanded greatly in recent years and is the dominant form of heating for multi-family apartment buildings and commercial premises in our urban areas. The number of detached houses heated by district heating is also increasing steadily. This is a positive trend, since district heating is an efficient, reliable, economical and flexible solution offering the options of utilising available biofuels, waste fuels and industrial waste heat. District heating also has an important role to play in Sweden’s energy and climate policy by allowing the possibility of simultaneous production of electricity and heat in highly efficient CHP (combined heat and power) plants and thereby a much more efficient utilisation of fuels.</p>
<p>There is a risk that the criticism that has emerged in recent years towards the strong position of the district heating companies in relation to their customers will delay or prevent the further development of this socially beneficial form of heating. It is claimed in the public debate that the district heating companies have in practice a monopoly, enabling them to control prices without any other alternative for the customers to respond than the very costly investments associated with switching to another form of heating. If customers lose confidence in their ability to influence the future price trend for district heating, those who have alternatives may choose them even though they are economically inferior today merely because they feel they have more influence over price and other important factors over those alternatives.</p>
<h2>The assignment</h2>
<p>My assignment has been to shed light on the competitive situation of district heating on the heating markets, to propose measures to improve protection of the consumer against unfair pricing of district heating, and to examine the need for and ways to criminalise bypassing of heat meters in district heating systems.</p>
<p>The assignment has included analysing the need for price supervision on the district heating market and, if this is deemed necessary, to propose a regulatory framework and supervision model for the district heating market. A point of departure for this work has been equivalent regulatory frameworks for the electricity and natural gas markets. I have also studied other systems for supervision, such as price comparisons, and price ceilings and index regulation.</p>
<h2>Goal of the proposals</h2>
<p>The primary goal of the proposals presented in this interim report is to improve the customers’ situation so that they can feel more secure in their contractual relationship with the district heating companies. If customers are given an opportunity to judge how efficiently and economically the district heating company conducts its operations and at the same time have an influence over price and other important parameters, the continued development of district heating should also have positive environmental effects for society.</p>
<h2>A package of measures for increased customer security</h2>
<p>Unbundling of the accounts of district heating and cooling operations</p>
<p>In order to increase customer security, the interim report “Enhancing the security of district heating consumers – Greater transparency and separation of electricity and district heating operations” (SOU 2003:115) proposed that the companies that conduct district heating operations should be obligated to keep the accounts for these operations separate from those for other operations in the company. I support this proposal and propose that it should also apply to district cooling operations. The requirement concerning separate (unbundled) accounts for district heating and cooling operations is general and means that these operations should be accounted for in such a way that all business transactions and allocations within the operations can be traced and verified.</p>
<p>Separation of district heating and electricity market operations</p>
<p>It was proposed in the previous interim report that district heating operations and electricity market operations should not be allowed to be conducted in the same company (legal separation). Nor should such operations be conducted in companies with a common board majority or managing director (functional separation). If half of the board members do have such double functions, the same prohibition should apply to the chairman of the board. I support this proposal as well and propose that it should also apply to district cooling operations.</p>
<p>Reporting of key figures in the operation</p>
<p>I propose that the requirement on unbundling of the accounts that has been proposed in the interim report be supplemented with a requirement that concerned companies should submit annually to the Swedish Energy Agency (Energimyndigheten) including a number of key figures that reflect the company’s operations and the relationship between costs and price. These figures should be collected in a database to be made available to all. This would provide a benchmark for entailing yardstick competition between different district heating producers. At the same time, it should improve the chances of reaching a consensus between customers and companies regarding the terms of the business. The proposal is intended to make it more difficult for the suppliers to justify prices that are perceived as being unreasonably high.</p>
<p>Contract terms</p>
<p>I propose that the increased transparency and improved opportunities for judging the companies’ performance, that follow from the proposals for unbundled accounts and key figure reporting, should be supplemented with additional measures that strengthen the customers’ situation. In order to provide basic contractual protection for district heating and cooling customers by phasing out unreasonable contract terms etc., I propose that contract terms for delivery of district heating and cooling be worked out by the Swedish Energy Agency and the Swedish Consumer Agency (Konsumentverket) after consultation with the concerned sectors. The resultant standard contract is expected to be utilised if not by all then by most of the companies. The standard contract should contain the provisions necessary to give private consumers in particular a satisfactory contractual situation.</p>
<p>Right to negotiation</p>
<p>Certain terms are of particular importance for district heating customers. In order to further strengthen the customers’ position and give them greater opportunities to influence their contractual situation, I propose that a district heating customer should be entitled to negotiate with the district heating company at the time of his connection to an existing district heating network and in conjunction with unilateral changes in terms during the current contractual period. The contract terms covered by the negotiation obligation are price, connection capacity and whatever other terms may be unilaterally changed by the supplier. This right should also exist for district cooling customers.</p>
<p>The right to negotiation is matched by an obligation on the part of the district heating and cooling companies to enter into negotiations with good will at the customer’s request. The right to negotiation should be provided for in the above-mentioned standard contract, but should also be guaranteed by law.</p>
<p>Mechanism for mediation and dispute settlement</p>
<p>District heating customers are to a great extent in a weaker position in terms of power and information than their contractual counterpart. In order to ensure that the customers’ influence is more than just formal and to give the customers greater confidence in the district heating and cooling suppliers’ operations, an opportunity should be provided to submit negotiation and contractual disputes to a third, neutral party for settlement.</p>
<p>In the event a negotiation initiated by reason of the right to negotiation does not result in an agreement between the parties, I propose that a board created for this purpose within the Swedish Energy Agency should, at the request of either party, be empowered to mediate in the negotiation dispute. This board – called the District Heating Board (Fjärrvärmenämnden) – will, according to my proposal, also deal with other disputes referred to them by customers or consumers. The Board will hand down decisions on how a dispute should be solved in the form of recommendations. The recommendations will be made public.</p>
<p>I further proposed that when assigned to settle a case, the Board should consist of an impartial chairman with experience as a judge, one impartial technical expert and two special members, one of whom should have experience from district heating or cooling operations from a producer perspective and the other from a customer perspective. The Government should appoint the members of the Board. The special members will, according to my proposal, be nominated by the organisations that represent a majority of the customers, consumers and companies in the areas in question.</p>
<p>Model for analysing district heating prices</p>
<p>Through the proposed mechanism for mediation and dispute settlement, the District Heating Board will be empowered to adjudicate price issues as well. To support the District Heating Board in this work, I propose that the Swedish Energy Agency be assigned the task of developing a model for judging costs and prices. When used together with the proposed database with key figures, such a model also provides a means for the aforementioned benchmarking for yardstick competition.</p>
<p>Other systems for price supervision</p>
<p>A review of different available methods for price regulation is also presented in this report. It is my judgement that every form of price regulation entails a trade-off between the goal that the customer should pay as low a price as possible and the incentive required for investors to create a positive dynamic and stimulate development in the sector in question. The choice of regulation method depends on which aspect is given priority. Regardless of which price regulation method is deemed to be most suitable, it will be associated with a number of problems that could have repercussions on the development of district heating. It is therefore my conclusion that it is urgent for both theoretical and practical reasons to avoid wherever possible resorting to methods of this kind.</p>
<p>It is my opinion that the proposed package of measures will significantly improve the district heating customers’ situation and thereby eliminate the fears that could lead to a less favourable development of district heating and cooling in the future. During the course of the investigation, the district heating sector has, in cooperation with its customers in the so-called Heating Market Committee, developed an equivalent package of measures for quality rating of district heating companies.</p>
<p>In view of the district heating sector’s promised self-regulation and the expected positive effects of the measures proposed in the report, I do not propose more traditional price regulation at this time.</p>
<p>A District Heating Act</p>
<p>The various measures that I propose in this interim report for improving customer protection will be gathered in a special District Heating Act (fjärrvärmelag). The structure of such an Act is presented in the report. A final draft of this statute will be presented in the Commission’s final report, which will be submitted in the spring of 2005.</p>
<p>Criminalisation of heat theft etc .</p>
<p>The current penal code covers most of the methods that are used to bypass metering equipment in a district heating or cooling system. However, there are certain difficulties involved in classifying a crime aimed at accessing the thermal energy and not just involving the physical measures required for such access. Some uncertainty must be considered to exist as to whether all procedures should give rise to criminal liability. I therefore propose that a special penalty provision be introduced in the Swedish Penal Code (brottsbalken) aimed at illicit diversions of thermal energy from a district heating or cooling system. The crime of illicit diversion of thermal energy should be subdivided into three degrees by introducing a special scale for crimes of the normal degree and crimes of a felonious nature. Misdemeanours should not give rise to criminal liability.</p>
<h2>Supervision</h2>
<p>The proposals in the interim report “Enhancing the security of district heating consumers – Greater transparency and separation of electricity and district heating operations” (SOU 2003:115) and in this report are aimed at guaranteeing district heating and cooling customers’ security and confidence in their heating and cooling services. In order for this purpose to be achieved, it is necessary to have effective supervision with means to verify compliance with the rules stemming from the proposals and sanctions that can be imposed in the event of non-compliance. I therefore propose that rules of supervision be introduced that are roughly equivalent to those imposed by the Swedish Electricity Act (ellagen) and that follow from our previous proposal. These rules will be included in the new District Heating Act, which I propose.</p>
<p>I further propose that an authority be appointed to exercise the supervision that is required to verify that the proposed measures for increased customer security are implemented. It should be up to the Government to determine which authority is to exercise supervision in the district heating and cooling field. However, I recommend that this supervisory task be assigned to the Swedish Energy Agency.</p>
<h2>Consequences</h2>
<p>The measures that follow from my proposals will entail official costs. I propose that the cost for supervision entailed by the pro- posals be financed by imposition of a supervisory charge on enter- prises conducting district heating or cooling operations. The size of the charge should be proportional to the quantity of thermal energy sold or received.</p>
<p>The dispute settlement service that I propose should be provided under the auspices of the Swedish Energy Agency and should be financed from the resources allocated to the Swedish Energy Agency in the latest budget bill for its activities in e.g. the district heating field.</p>
<p>My proposals will also give rise to costs for the district heating and cooling companies. It is my judgement that the requirement on unbundled accounting and reporting of key figures, as well as the dispute settlement mechanism, entail a relatively modest burden for concerned district heating and cooling operators. The require- ment on legal and functional separation and on the customer’s right of negotiation may, however, entail certain costs. However, the costs are not of such a nature that, considering the number of affected companies and their structure, they would in themselves lead to the elimination or consolidation of small enterprises, nor to other adverse consequences. I have therefore not found reason to recommend any exemptions for small enterprises.</p>
