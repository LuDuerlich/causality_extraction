<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Sweden: an aquacultural nation in the making</h2>
<p>Globally, aquaculture has been the segment of the food industry with the most rapid growth during the last decades. Soon half of the fish consumed in the world will be of farmed origin. The UN food organization FAO has shown that aquaculture (i.e. the farming of fish and shellfish) has to expand strongly for humanity to consume fish and shellfish at today’s level. Against this background, this inquiry finds that there are good opportunities for a growing aquaculture industry in Sweden.</p>
<p>A major unexploited resource in our country, which can be used for good advantage to aquaculture, is the regulated lakes and waterpower reservoirs along the dammed rivers in the north parts of the country. These waters were naturally poor in nutrients, but, after water regulation, have been further depleted to what are now almost sterile conditions. Cultivation of fish in these waters would be a restoration action as the increased amount of nutrients would serve to bring the aquatic environment closer to the natural state.</p>
<p>Sweden is on the whole a nation rich in waters with 95 700 lakes of more than one hectare in size, and with a very long coast. The lakes cover nine per cent of the nation’s surface, approximately 40 000 square kilometres. Clearly, Sweden has a great potential for aquaculture when viewed against this background. Yet, Swedish aquaculture is presently a relatively small branch compared with other branches nationally or compared with aquaculture in many other nations. This forms the background to the Minister of Agriculture giving us the task to propose actions to ensure the development of an ecologically and economically sustainable aquaculture.</p>
<p>The task also included identification of species with the best potential for farming, both in the short and in the long term. At present rainbow trout dominates aquaculture in Sweden, as a food fish but also for stocking purposes. Our assessment is that there is still a considerable potential for development of rainbow trout farming in the future, above all for farming in lakes poor in nutrients. Other species we find that can expand in the near future are Arctic charr for cultivation in cold, regulated lakes in the inland of north Sweden and mussels and oysters on the Swedish west coast. In a somewhat longer perspective also other species may be of value for Swedish aquaculture.</p>
<p>It is in the interest of society to ensure the development of an economically and ecologically sustainable aquaculture in Sweden. A growing aquaculture industry produces tasty and environmentally friendly food with a relatively small impact on climate, it creates jobs and growth in rural areas, particularly in sparsely populated geographic areas. Aquaculture products may become an important part in realization of the vision of Sweden as a culinary nation.</p>
<p>For the above reasons, the inquiry has developed an action plan with 13 measures aiming at providing prerequisites for development of the Swedish aquaculture industry. A realization of the action plan demands a financial commitment from the government which should be regarded as an investment in new jobs, regional development and growth. The proposals in the action plan focus on supporting excellent entrepreneurs willing to work for making Sweden the important aquaculture nation it has the potential to be.</p>
<p>We estimate that the realization of the action plan means a government stake of 60 MSEK per year during a five year period. At an increase of aquaculture production to 50 000 tonnes per year, and the number of new job opportunities will be on the order of 1 100 full time jobs, preferably in rural areas.</p>
<h2>The action plan consists of the following items:</h2>
<p>A national strategy  will be developed in order to give better opportunities for aquaculture to grow within an ecologically sustainable framework. The strategy also aims at modernizing and positively changing the attitude towards aquaculture. The aquaculture industry will be strengthened as an industry of its own within the common fisheries policy.</p>
<p>Coordination of aquaculture issues will be made. The Swedish Board of Fisheries will be given an enhanced mandate to work with aquaculture, by, among other things, the establishment of a Coordination Office at the Board. The office will be responsible for coordination, information, advising and collecting of statistics in the field of aquaculture.</p>
<p>Simplification of rules and reduced bureaucracy are important aims within aquaculture industry as well as in business in general. To reduce complications and shorten handling time “one door in” will be established with applications for aquaculture permissions. Responsibility for monitoring aquaculture will be transferred to regional inspectors specialized in the field. The position of aquaculture as an industry of its own is marked by collecting all paragraphs that concern aquaculture in all regulations regarding fishing and aquaculture.</p>
<p>Improved planning  is important in order to facilitate the establishment of new aquaculture enterprises. Municipalities and counties are therefore urged to identify suitable locations for various forms of aquacultural undertakings in their planning. Concerned authorities will make an overview of areas of national interest for different sectors of aquaculture.</p>
<p>In order to improve knowledge regarding new aquacultural undertakings, a better assessment of the environment  is needed. The Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SUAS) is therefore given the task to monitor and analyze the environmental impacts of aquaculture. A standard model, adapted to Nordic conditions, for estimation of nutrient load is developed.</p>
<p>Marketing and information  are of great importance if aquaculture products are to be successful in the marketplace. Support is thus given to a five year information campaign about the advantages of cultivated fish, mussels and oysters, which will be performed by the industry jointly with other actors. Actions are taken to safeguard functional logistics and continuous deliveries.</p>
<p>Quality assurance and certification increase credibility in products. The industry is encouraged to introduce a distinctive identifying logo to indicate the certification of environmentally</p>
<p>friendly aquaculture products produced in Sweden. Guidelines are constructed to facilitate certification.</p>
<p>Education and professional training are central issues for development and professionalization of the aquaculture industry. A special, voluntary, “aquaculturalist’s license” is established. Vocational training should be offered to future aquaculturalists. The training could occur in cooperation with our Nordic neighbours to great advantage. The work to form academic aquaculture training continues in cooperation with neighbouring nations.</p>
<p>Research and development  is a strategic field for development of aquaculture, to meet the industry’s short term need of applied research, as well as society’s long term goals. Governments support to aquaculture research should accordingly be strengthened. Research is needed on, for example, feed, genetics, fish health and fish diseases, technical development, environmental impact and circulation of nutrients.</p>
<p>High quality brood stock material must be secured for the industry. Government support for breeding work is therefore of outmost importance. The Arctic charr breeding programme at the fisheries research station in Kälarne is to be developed and opportunities for a national rainbow trout breeding programme are to be investigated.</p>
<p>Improved access to capital  is of major importance for growth of the aquaculture industry. For that reason the government should make a directed effort in this field. Sufficient public co-financing must be available for grants from European Fisheries Fund and structural funds. Furthermore, state credit guarantees for investments in aquaculture should be considered, to give enterprises better opportunities to raise bank loans. A generally improved access to risk capital for enterprises in rural areas, especially in sparsely populated areas, is a key issue for the future.</p>
<p>Aquaculture is still a small industry that has much to gain from cooperation across national borders. Cooperation within EU and with neighbouring nations  should therefore be developed. As previously stressed, this applies also to research and education. The Swedish EU Presidency, in autumn 2009, should be actively used to</p>
<p>contribute to the coming EU strategy for a sustainable development of the aquaculture industry in Europe.</p>
<p>Since the major exploitation of rivers for electric power in the 1950s and 1960s the power companies are, by court decisions, obliged to carry out compensatory stocking of fish, in particular Atlantic salmon and sea trout. We suggest appointing a Committee of inquiry of the future compensatory measures . That study should evaluate if present day system of compensatory releases is the most effective and sustainable way to use the resources the power companies are obliged to provide in order to compensate for damage to the fishery, or if they can be used in a more sustainable manner.</p>
