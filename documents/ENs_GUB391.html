<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>In the summer of 2003 five tragedies happened in a short period of time involving offenders well known from earlier contacts with different psychiatric facilities. These tragedies, which culminated in the murder of the former Swedish Minister of Foreign Affairs, caused a great deal of anger and frustration in the Swedish society. Shortly after these incidences the National Psychiatric Services Coordination, NPSC, was founded in November 2003. The Government commissioned the NPSC to analyse Swedish psychiatric services and their shortcomings from practically every possible angle. The NPSC was given three years to propose measures needed in order to raise the standard of the psychiatric services and develop models for better coordination between services provided by county councils and municipalities.</p>
<p>Current regulations</p>
<p>Since 1992, there have been two laws in effect in Sweden regulating compulsory psychiatric treatment. One for mentally disturbed individuals in general and another for those who have commited crimes while suffering from one or more serious mental disorders. The law concerning the latter category is called the Forensic Mental Care Act.</p>
<p>This law stipulates that if an offender at the time of the crime suffers from a severe mental disorder  the court cannot sentence him or her to prison. If the offender is in need of psychiatric care he or she can be sentenced to forensic psychiatric care. The definition of a severe mental disorder includes psychotic disorders, severe depressive disorders with a risk of suicide, and, in some cases, severe personality disorders.</p>
<p>Most offenders diagnosed with personality disorders are not legally considered to suffer from a severe mental disorder. They are</p>
<p>thus legally responsible for their actions and consequently may be sentenced to prison. Psychiatric treatment, if required in such cases, must be provided whithin prison on a voluntary basis or by referral from the prison to a psychiatric hospital. As soon as the patient sufficiently recovers, he or she must return to prison.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Forensic Mental Care Act deals with two separate categories of patients: patients U with U  and patients without U U  a special court assessment before discharge. The court assigns the classification to each case based on whether or not there is a risk of relapse into serious crime. In cases subject to special court assessment, the court bears the responsibility of granting any temporary leave of absence as well as final discharge from hospital. A sentence to forensic psychiatric care without special court assessment implies that the psychiatrist in charge of treatment also determs the extent of detention required in each case.</p>
<p>Forensic psychiatric treatment may be given at any psychiatric hospital that can guarantee the required level of security. There are also additional psychiatric hospital wards on the regional level for the treatment of patients who suffer from the most severe forms of mental disorders and/or are considered to be particularly prone to violent and aggressive outbursts. These hospital services are run and financed by the twentyone county councils.</p>
<p>A sentence to forensic psychiatric treatment is always based on the results of a forensic psychiatric evaluation. Such evaluations are conducted and financed by the state, and are provided by four special units under the direction of the National Board of Forensic Medicine.</p>
<p>When patients are discharged from hospital, the 290 municipalities are responsible for assisting them with housing and arrangements for rehabilitation etc. As mentioned above the main task of the NPSC is to find solutions to improve coordination between the services provided by the county councils and municipalities.</p>
<p>Proposals</p>
<p>The NPSC proposes a wide range of changes nationally as well as on the county council and municipal level. On the national level, the NPSC proposes establishing a special authority to serve and coordinate the development of the different services involved in taking care of mentally disturbed offenders. This authority should</p>
<p>also analyse the outcome of the care provided. To do so the authority must have a special national data acquisition system that gathers data from all of the facilities involved on a daily basis. The NPSC also proposes that the state provide national funding to the county councils and the municipalities that fulfil the criteria for a good standard as stipulated at the national level.</p>
<p>The NPSC also proposes some changes in legislation to more clearly define the county councils’ responsibilities for the psychiatric care of offenders serving prison sentences and those serving sentences in special wards for young offenders. These responsibilities also include the coordination of efforts necessary when the court sentences offenders to probation on condition that they complete a programme of psychiatric care.</p>
<p>Another legislative issue also pointed out by the NPSC is the responsibility of the county councils to provide full service to forensic psychiatry inmates when it comes to arranging and offering programmes for alcohol and drug abusers. Reducing alcohol and drug abuse is one of the most important factors in order to reduce the risk for relapse.</p>
<p>The NPSC also proposes that the courts should have the possibility of sentencing a mentally deficient offender or person with autism etc. who also suffers from a psychiatric disorder, but does not fulfil the severe mental disorder criteria to forensic psychiatric care. In these rare cases, about twenty per year, care should be provided in line with the Forensic Mental Care Act, and be administered by the county councils and provided in small, well-staffed units.</p>
<p>Moreover, as the responsibility of providing healthcare is in the hands of each county council, which is a cause of variation between the different parts of the country and across the units, the NPSC makes some detailed recommendations on what must be done on the local level to raise the standard of care. In brief, these recommendations are the following:</p>
<p>• forensic psychiatric services under the direction of county councils should be responsible for the assessment and care of mentally disordered prison inmates and those that are sentenced to probation on condition of outpatient psychiatric care,</p>
<p>• forensic psychiatric services should comprise resource centre for risk assessment, identification and care of aggressive, mentally disordered healthcare patients,</p>
<p>• forensic psychiatric services should conduct and have programmes for the evaluation and treatment of alcohol and drug abuse for the patients cared for under the Forensic Mental Care Act,</p>
<p>• forensic psychiatric services should have teams that properly guide patients through the system in connection with, and for some time after, discharge,</p>
<p>• active care planning for each patient should be carried out, documented and followed up with the municipality and other actors,</p>
<p>• agreements should be in place with the municipalities involved on how care should be organised after the period of institutional care.</p>
<p>Additionally, a good discharge from institutional care requires that the municipalities have adequate living and occupational alternatives to take care of discharged patients. The above mentioned national co-funding of the care of mentally disordered offenders should be based on these recommendations being met.</p>
<p>Implementation</p>
<p>The implementation of the proposals involves rather extensive amendments to existing law and regulations. However, due to the existing problems within the field, it is important that the proposals be implemented without undue delay. Considering that reasonable time must be allocated to the legislative consultative process, the future drafting of the proposals within the Government Offices and the processing of the matter in the Swedish parliament, the reforms may enter into effect on 1 January 2009 at the earliest.</p>
<p>It is, however, important to mention that even before the NPSC proposals are in effect and legislation has passed the Parliament, every possible effort must be made in order to improve the standard of care and rehabilitation of mentally disordered offenders. The direction of these efforts is outlined in this report. The NPSC proposes that efforts at the national level be led by a voluntary organisation in collaboration between the state, the county councils and the municipalities. Extensive efforts must also be made in each one of the local wards and units involved in the care and rehabilitation of mentally disordered offenders.</p>
