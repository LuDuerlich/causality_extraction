<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>Issues associated with violence against children have again, in the past few years, been a focus of discussions at both national and local level. Child abuse has been addressed in parliamentary motions and public debate by the Child Ombudsman and childrights organisations. The National Council for Crime Prevention (BRÅ) has shown that the number of incidents reported to the police involving assaults on children has risen.</p>
<p>This was the background to the Swedish Government’s creation, in December 1998, of a parliamentary committee to investigate the issue of child abuse and related matters. The committee’s members and secretariat were appointed and its investigation began in spring 1999. The committee adopted the title of the Committee against Child Abuse. Its assignment was to be completed by 31 March 2001, but it was to present an interim report on the working methods of the police and prosecutors after an extension decision not later than 1 May 2000. In April 2000 the interim report, ‘Child Abuse Case Handling Times and Working Methods of the Police and Prosecutors’  (SOU 2000:42), was issued. The deadline for the Committee’s investigation has also been extended and its final report on the assignment is to be issued not later than on 31 August 2001.</p>
<p>We are now issuing herewith, in accordance with the directives, the Committee’s final report. Its title is ‘Child Abuse Prevention and Protection’.</p>
<p>Under the directives, the long-term aims of our inquiry were to improve the scope for preventing violence against children, to achieve better collaboration among the various agencies that investigate and deal with child abuse, to enhance knowledge among the occupational groups concerned, and to devise better means of supporting and helping those involved.</p>
<p>Under the same directives, the inquiry was to be permeated by a child perspective and based on the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. The key articles of the Convention in our work are, above all, Article 3 (the best interests of the child), Article 12 (the child’s freedom to express views and right to be heard) and Article 19 (protection from abuse). Articles 34 (protection against sexual exploitation) and Article 39 (rehabilitation) have also been important. We have based our proposals on the best interests of the child, and in several cases we propose measures to benefit all children, by the same token including children in distress or at risk.</p>
<h2>Chapter 2. Child abuse in society an introduction</h2>
<p>This chapter describes the points of departure for our work. Starting with children’s comments on violence, we discuss the concept of a ‘child perspective’ and the importance of social security for children and families. A brief history of child abuse and, finally, some observations on attitudes towards corporal punishment in other countries are included in this chapter.</p>
<p>The section containing children’s comments provides a picture of how disadvantaged children may perceive their own situation. Every year, children make many telephone calls about child abuse on the special Children’s Helpline of BRIS (‘Children’s Rights in Society’). Our quotations are examples of what these children have to tell.</p>
<p>Sixty-three per cent of the calls come from girls, and 37 per cent from boys. Most of the callers are more than 12 years old. More often than for ‘average calls’, the children who are subjected to violence live with a single father or in a stepfamily. The abuse usually takes place in the home. In more than eight out of ten cases, the assault is committed by a family member. This also applies, in more than half of the cases, to the considerably fewer calls concerning mental abuse.</p>
<p>The section entitled ‘Focus on the child perspective’ describes how the Convention on the Rights of the Child has gained ground throughout society. Children are seen as autonomous individuals, entitled to influence decisions relating both to their personal situation and to society as a whole. The child perspective is clarified, above all, in Article 3 (on the best interests of the child  as a primary consideration ) and Article 12 (on children’s  right to express their views freely ), which together make up the foundations of a child perspective. The nature of a child perspective is not something defined once and for all. Its basic component must be respect for the full human dignity and integrity of the child. But children are also dependent on adults. They cannot be accorded a full right of  self-determination,  and they therefore need adults to assume responsibility for protecting their integrity.</p>
<p>One fundamental conflict of interests relates to the needs and rights of children in relation to their guardians’ responsibilities and interests, i.e. the relative weights of parental responsibility and the child as an independent legal person. Moreover, when public agencies genuinely attempt to make the best interests of the child their primary consideration, their decisions may conflict with parents’ interests.</p>
<p>The Convention expresses the signatories’ view that the family is the natural environment for children’s development and welfare. This is among the assumptions stated in the section on children’s social security. The families should therefore receive support so that it can shoulder its responsibility. In some cases, public professional support from healthcare or social services, for example is required, and in some cases children need protection.</p>
<p>Children’s welfare is affected by family circumstances, but also by the schools they attend, for example. Favourable factors at preschool or school can offset other shortcomings in a child’s social situation. The number of adults surrounding children as they grow up has evidently decreased, and this probably has the most harmful impact on disadvantaged children with weak social networks.</p>
<p>Should society concentrate on broad welfare systems or measures focusing on children growing up in ‘risk environments’? Or are direct, individual inputs the way to achieve the best results? Regarding what measures are needed, the answer is to be found at every level. Many families get by thanks to a high overall standard of welfare. For children in disadvantaged areas, extra resources may be needed to prevent severe problems from arising. For the individual child who grows up in a risk environment, special attention from the adult world is required.</p>
<p>In the section on ‘Child abuse in history’, we find that violence against children is a timeless and international problem. Children have been beaten and assaulted in every epoch and in most cultures. In the past, parents’ right to spank their children was regarded as self-evident.</p>
<p>Sweden’s first legislation on child care was passed in 1926. Society then gained, for the first time, an opportunity to take into custody certain children who were subjected to abuse or neglect in the home. Violence against children for disciplinary purposes was still, however, accepted.</p>
<p>In 1962, the American doctor C. Henry Kempe coined the expression ‘the battered-child syndrome’. Previous hypotheses about mysterious infectious diseases contracted by certain children could now be dismissed, and the patterns of injury typical of abused children were discerned. For the first time, the previously masked phenomenon of child abuse was emphasised as a major and real social problem. Awareness of child abuse was thus transformed during these decades: from being an amorphous affliction that belonged in the healthcare sector, it became recognised as a substantial social problem.</p>
<p>In Sweden, corporal punishment in schools was prohibited in the primary-education code of 1958. It would, however, be another 21 years before the Swedish Parliament, on 1 July 1979, adopted the ‘anti-spanking law’ (Chapter 6, Section 1 of the Swedish Code on Parents and Children). The provision lays down that children may not be subjected to ‘corporal punishment or other humiliating treatment’.</p>
<p>In the section ‘Some views of corporal punishment’, we find that there are ten countries at present that have explicitly prohibited both physical and mental abuse of children. Discussions and legislative work on this matter are under way in several countries.</p>
<p>At the UN General Assembly Special Session on Children in autumn 2001, Sweden will focus on child abuse by providing information in a report on implementation of the ban on corporal punishment in Sweden. The Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA), too, is emphasising the Swedish attitude in its negotiations with countries that are candidates for economic assistance in the education sector.</p>
<p>For the first time, the statement that children have rights has been put down in writing in the EU. This took place in 2000 at the Nice summit, where member countries proclaimed a charter on fundamental rights that coherently expresses EU citizens’ rights in various areas. Children are now regarded as an interest group in their own right, with needs and rights of their own.</p>
<h2>Chapter 3. Definition of child abuse</h2>
<p>We propose  the following definition:</p>
<p>Child abuse is when an adult</p>
<p>• subjects a child to physical or psychological violence, sexual assault, humiliating treatment, or</p>
<p>• fails to meet the child’s basic needs</p>
<p>A ‘child’ being defined as every human being under the age of 18 years.</p>
<p>We propose  a comprehensive definition of the term ‘child abuse’ and believe that this kind of definition enables public agencies, organisations and others to give a practical, specific form to what the definition means in their own activities.</p>
<p>Defining child abuse as assault, as defined in the Penal Code, does not afford an accurate notion of what causes children’s distress, what treatment they must not be subjected to or what measures must be taken in order to prevent a child from being maltreated or at risk. Our definition is thus broader than the definition of assault in criminal law contained in Chapter 3, Section 5 of the Penal Code.</p>
<p>Physical abuse may entail the adult striking the child with or without an instrument, pinching, kicking, shoving, throwing, shaking, scratching or biting the child, pulling the child’s hair, trampling or stamping on the child, or forcing objects into the child’s mouth. Poisoning, burning, scalding, scratching and trying to drown or suffocate the child are also forms of physical abuse.</p>
<p>Mental or psychological abuse includes, for example, unduly severe punishment, ridicule, criticism, scorn, disparagement, rejection, ostracism, unreasonable demands or constant refusal to listen to the child’s views. Mental abuse can also be forcing the child to witness (see or hear) violence in his or her immediate surroundings, or to live in an environment in which violence or the threat of violence is a recurrent feature.</p>
<p>Humiliating treatment may, for example, entail making disparaging comments on the child’s appearance, speech or intelligence, saying that the child is not good enough or that siblings are much more attractive and more successful, hitting or insulting the child in front of his or her friends or adults, reading the child’s diary and so forth.</p>
<p>Physical neglect applies to all aspects of the child’s physical health and development, i.e. hygiene, diet and care, clothing appropriate for the season, scope for rest and sleep, shelter and accommodation, supervision, preventive healthcare, medical and dental care, and protection against accidents.</p>
<p>Mental neglect may, for example, be inaccessibility and indifference to the child (verging on mental abuse), failing to give the child experience, and omitting to teach the child what is right and wrong.</p>
<h2>Chapter 4. The incidence of child abuse</h2>
<p>In January 2001 we presented a report entitled ‘Children and Abuse’  (SOU 2001:18). The report states that the use of corporal punishment as a method of upbringing has decreased, and that the increased number of reports to the police of child abuse is probably due to adults’ greater vigilance and reduced tolerance towards violence against children.</p>
<p>In our study comprising interviews with parents year 2000, which is part of the above-mentioned report, 8.3 per cent of the parents replied ‘yes’ to the question of whether they had used any form of physical punishment in the past year. The corresponding figure in 1980 was 51.3 per cent. However, 4 per cent of middleschool pupils (aged 10 12) and 7 per cent of young adults still state that they have been subjected, on some occasion during their childhood, to severe physical punishment with the use of instruments of one kind or another.</p>
<p>Around 1 per cent of children and adolescents are subjected to very severe and unusual forms of punishment, such as knife and firearm threats. It is uncertain whether there has been any decrease in these very severe forms of punishment. This figure has remained broadly unchanged over the past few years.</p>
<p>In our report, we have also examined the repercussions on children of violence in close relationships. Our studies show that roughly 10 per cent of all children have on some occasion experienced violence in the home, and that around 5 per cent experience it frequently.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we also cite the numbers of reports to the police concerning child abuse during the year 2000; 938 incidents involving abuse of children aged up to six, and 5,625 incidents concerning abuse of children aged from seven to 14. In nearly three-quarters of cases, the abuse of young children reported to the police was committed by an unknown perpetrator indoors, against 45 per cent for the higher age group. Another difference is in outdoor abuse by a person unknown to the child, which makes up 22 per cent of the offences against children aged from seven to 14, against 10 per cent of those against children up to six.</p>
<p>It is essential to be aware that abuse of children is a crime that goes unreported to a high degree. Accordingly, crime statistics of offences reported to the police are a relatively poor indicator of the actual scope  of child abuse.</p>
<p>It is also highly probable that a change in people’s propensity to report the matter took place in the 1990s. This makes it even more difficult to draw conclusions about the actual trend.</p>
<h2>Chapter 5. Collaboration</h2>
<p>We propose  that the Swedish Government commission the National Board of Health and Welfare, the National Police Board and the National Agency for Education to jointly draw up a strategy for collaboration in issues relating to children who are in distress or at risk. The strategy would be intended as support for local collaboration in particular, since we deem that the most important work for disadvantaged children takes place in the local community. Agencies concerned should have a statutory responsibility to collaborate.</p>
<p>We propose  that new clauses concerning collaboration therefore be inserted in the Social Services Act, the Health and Medical Services Act, the Act on professional activities in the healthcare sector, and the Education Act. The Police Act already contains a corresponding clause.</p>
<p>We propose  that the social services be given, by law, special responsibility to work for this collaboration. Based on their ultimate accountability and responsibility for carrying out investigations, the social services have a self-evident role as coordinator and hub of activities.</p>
<p>We propose , moreover, that the Swedish Government’s Circular (1970:513) concerning cooperation between social welfare committees, schools and the police be annulled. The provisions in this circular appear not to have been applied for many years.</p>
<p>Local collaboration should take place both on a general level, to draw attention to situations and environments that entail distress or risk for children, and on an individual level for example, in cases of child abuse. It is invariably local conditions and circumstances that govern this collaboration and determine which parties work together.</p>
<p>For a child subjected to abuse, for example, we consider that the working methods along the lines of a ‘child conference’ can be developed. A child conference is a form of joint meeting in complex child-custody cases, where the various principals collaborate with the child as far as the child’s age and maturity permit and his or her family, and possibly with all those concerned. The purpose is to develop working methods and offer measures based on the child’s needs, in which it is the responsibility of agencies concerned to participate. Development of methods and measures should take place in association with evaluation and research in social work.</p>
<p>This chapter poses the question of whether collaboration is a successful approach. Then follows a review of different preconditions for collaboration. Many people’s needs and problems today are so complex that no principal alone can bring about a satisfactory solution. A variety of skills and resources are required for good measures of helping the abused or neglected child, and the child’s family, to be identified. When a major accident or disaster takes place in society, various agencies show that collaboration is necessary to help the victims.</p>
<h2>Chapter 6. Reporting to the social welfare committee</h2>
<p>The results of various surveys show that only a small proportion of children suspected of being in distress are reported to social welfare committees. Reporting rates vary between occupational groups that have an obligation to report such situations, but are low in all groups.</p>
<p>Provisions concerning the obligation to report are contained in Section 71 of the Social Services Act (1980:620, SoL). On 1 January 2002 a new Social Services Act will enter into force (SFS 2001:453). Chapter 14, Section 1 of the new Act contains a provision that, in content, corresponds to Section 71 of SoL.</p>
<p>We propose  that the word ‘protection’ in Section 71 of SoL (Chapter 14, Section 1 in SFS 2001:453) be replaced by the words ‘protection or support’. People who are obliged to report such matters have difficulty in determining when this obligation comes into effect. In the wording of the Act, the obligation is connected with a child’s need of protection. The preliminary legislative material states that a report should also be made when children may be assumed to need support or help. With the wording we propose, it should be easier for the people subject to this obligation to judge when a report should be made. The new wording has other advantages as well.</p>
<p>We propose  that the National Board of Health and Welfare be commissioned to issue general recommendations concerning information for the person who has reported a matter according to Section 71 of SoL (Chapter 14, Section 1). Various surveys show that the absence of feedback may result in professionals refraining from reporting such matters. It is perceived as frustrating not to know what happens after a report has been made. The provisions of the Secrecy Act (1980:100), it is true, prevent the social welfare committee from freely disclosing information about the personal circumstances of individuals. However, some facts may be provided.</p>
<p>We propose  that references to Section 71 of SoL be inserted into the Education Act (1985:1100), the Health and Medical Services Act (1982:763), the Dental Care Act (1985:125), the Act (1998:531) on professional activities in the healthcare sector and the Police Act (1984:387). Social welfare committees have an obligation to inform the public of their obligation to report these matters. Nevertheless, various facts show that these committees have difficulty in getting their message across in all quarters, and other measures are therefore also required to enhance awareness of the obligation and its implications in detail. The Social Services Act covers the work of social welfare committees. People who work with children in pre-school and youth education, child health services, dental care, etc may be assumed to be more familiar with their own legislation, and perceive that it affects them more, than other occupational groups. We also deem it likely that issues relating to the reporting obligation may be given more attention from executive management if the reference provisions are introduced.</p>
<p>We propose  that a special inquiry be initiated to address the issue of a counterpart to official misconduct for people working in the private sector who fail to submit a report under Section 71 of SoL (Chapter 14, Section 1). The fact that many professionals fail to fulfil their reporting obligation is a grave problem. The view is often expressed that increased scope is needed for society to react in these cases. Today, at any rate, certain people obliged to report such matters who fail to submit such reports run the risk of being adjudged liable for official misconduct under the Penal Code, or incurring a disciplinary sanction under provisions of labour law. However, it is probably not possible to cite official misconduct when staff in privately run activities fail to report a case.</p>
<p>We propose  that the reporting obligation under Section 71 of SoL (Chapter 14, Section 1 of the forthcoming Act) be extended to apply explicitly to prison and probation agencies and their employees. The National Prison and Probation Service may have reason to react to children’s circumstances in several different situations. We also propose that a reference to Section 71 be inserted in the Act (1974:203) on correctional treatment in institutions and the Ordinance (1998:642) on the execution of non-institutional correctional sanctions.</p>
<h2>Chapter 7. Social services</h2>
<p>We propose  measures to enhance skills in the social services. The overall objectives of the Degree Ordinance for training in social work and public administration should, we propose, be supplemented by a requirement that the students must have acquired knowledge of children’s life conditions and of the situation and circumstances of disadvantaged children. Staff who handle complex child-custody cases should have special skills. We propose  that a programme for developing skills supplementary training, for example be drawn up within the framework of the National Board of Health and Welfare’s national support for development of knowledge in the social services.</p>
<p>We assume that the cornerstones of social work include staff skills, good reception and collaboration. Bearing in mind the quality clause that the social services’ inputs must be of good quality, and that the work should be carried out by staff with suitable training and experience we recommend skills-enhancing measures. Special knowledge is required for taking a child into custody and successfully tackling the complex problems this entails, and the crisis that the child and the family are in.</p>
<p>Every year, the county administrative boards examine the municipalities’ social work. The National Board of Health and Welfare comments, and issues a report, on these observations. In its supervisory report for the year 2000, the Board states that the child perspective in the municipalities’ inquiries has become more prominent, that comprehensive solutions to children’s and families problems are aimed at, and that quality development and collaboration have improved. Local resources for non-institutional care have been developed, often in collaboration with other care providers. However, there are still shortcomings in administration and documentation. The municipalities have a tendency to tackle complex problems with local non-institutional care initially, but such measures do not always suffice. The supervisory authorities deem it worrying that the social services have difficulties in recruiting and retaining competent staff. This, in turn, may have adverse repercussions on the individual, who is often in a disadvantaged situation.</p>
<p>We propose  that, for two years, government funds of SEK 10 million be granted in each year for work to devise working methods and measures for children subjected to abuse or neglect, and work involving their families. This development work should be carried out jointly by the social services, schools, police, healthcare services and possibly other parties. The activities concerned should contribute funds corresponding at least to the amounts of project funds applied for. The projects should be linked to a research and development unit or an academic department of social work and public administration.</p>
<p>When a report is received by the social welfare committee there may, in some cases, be reasons to talk to the child without his or her guardian’s knowledge. The Commission on the Compulsory Care of Young Persons Act pinpointed this need in the course of its inquiry. We concur with their assessments and we propose  that this matter be investigated.</p>
<p>In cooperation with the county administrative board in Östergötland and this county’s 13 municipalities, we have conducted a study of cases of child abuse reported during 2000. The intention of this study was to clarify not only the social services’ work in response to these reports, but also their assessments and interaction with other principals that take place in connection with the reporting of a case. Our report includes a survey of measures taken in cases reported, who filed the reports, consultations, etc. More reports (20 per cent of the total) come from schools than from any other source. Child-health centres are the authority from which only a few cases are reported. The contributions of the police and prosecutors are included. Although the police give priority to cases of child abuse, decisions were taken during the year in only two-thirds of the cases, while information is lacking for the other cases. The study also demonstrates the need for a system of continuous statistical documentation. The statistics must be monitored over time to become an instrument for followup and analysis. In this study, too, the county administrative board cites the municipalities’ heavy workload for caseworkers in child and youth care. The report conveys a picture of children’s disadvantaged situation.</p>
<h2>Chapter 8. Pre-schools, schools and after-school recreation activities</h2>
<p>The introduction to this chapter discusses the importance of a comprehensive approach to pre-schools, schools and after-school recreation centres. We share the Pupil Welfare Committee’s view that health and learning go hand in hand. The Education Act (1985:1100) cites the category of children in need of special support . However, this phrase is not defined. We propose  that the Education Act Committee consider, in its work, the group of children to which this expression refers and decide to include children subjected to abuse or other forms of assault as well. Moreover, we propose  that head teachers’ responsibility for these children be clarified.</p>
<p>We propose  that the National Agency for Education be commissioned to carry out national surveys of children’s influence and participation in pre-school and school education. Under the Education Act and the curriculum, children are entitled to participate and exert influence in their pre-schools and schools. We consider that pupils who exert influence on the everyday running of their schools develop good relationships with and attitudes towards the adult staff. This can also result in improved scope for detecting and remedying the situation of children in distress. In a school where pupils meet many adults in the course of the day and where procedure for adult-child dialogue is not highly developed, it is relatively difficult to detect children in distress.</p>
<p>We propose  that the National Agency for Education be commissioned to issue general recommendations on the obligation to report to the social welfare committee. Our contacts with preschool and school representatives have indicated the need for a plan or routine, devised for each particular school, for dealing with cases where a child is in distress or at risk. The plan should be designed to support and help staff who encounter disadvantaged children. In our view, each pre-school and school should have a plan of this kind.</p>
<p>We propose  that, in their annual evaluation of the quality reports submitted to them, municipalities should examine how schools deal with children in distress.</p>
<p>We propose  that special examinations concerning children’s needs and development, with particular attention to children in distress, be inserted in teacher training, in the descriptions of aims contained in the Degree Ordinance. In our view, good skills are the precondition for detection of, and provision of help to, children in distress or at risk.</p>
<p>We propose  that the municipalities’ attention be drawn to their responsibility for developing the skills of staff in pre-schools, schools and after-school recreation centres concerning such matters as children in distress or at risk.</p>
<h2>Chapter 9. Healthcare services</h2>
<p>The healthcare services come into contact with child abuse in many different ways. Staff in some categories have reason to be aware of issues relating to children and child development although they do not even meet children. Examples of such activities are adult psychiatry and treatment of alcoholism and drug addiction. In all such activities, there should be routines to guide the staff in situations where it may be suspected that a child is being abused or neglected. Staff in the healthcare services that involve children are subject to other requirements. Besides the actual medical and nursing care provided, the way in which staff receive and respond to children is crucially important.</p>
<p>We propose  that provisions concerning the best interests of the child be inserted in the laws that regulate activities in the sphere of healthcare, i.e. the Health and Medical Services Act (1982:763), the Dental Care Act (1985:125) and the Act (1998:531) on professional activities in the healthcare sector (LYHS). When measures relate to children, particular attention should be devoted to what taking the best interests of the child into account entails: these interests must always be ascertained, but need not be decisive. Although the various categories of health professionals encounter child abuse in widely varying ways, they have one thing in common: the difficulty of detecting which children are in distress and of reporting to the social welfare committee that a child presumably needs the committee’s protection. A statutory child perspective is one way of drawing more attention to children and their needs and conditions. By the same token, scope for identifying children in distress is increased.</p>
<p>We propose , moreover, that LYHS be supplemented with a provision that acknowledges children’s right to express their views. This kind of provision may be seen as part of the work of ascertaining what is best for the child.</p>
<p>We propose  that the question of a guardian’s sole right to decide on a child’s care and treatment be dealt with in the overview, announced by the Government, of the 1998 custody reform. A perpetrator of child abuse is often one of the child’s parents. It has come to our attention that the legislation on joint custody has had repercussions on children’s scope for obtaining psychiatric care and treatment: if one of the guardians is opposed to the child receiving care or treatment, it is not unusual for the child to be turned away.</p>
<p>We propose  that special examinations concerning children and the situation of disadvantaged children be inserted in training for midwives, doctors, psychologists, nurses and dentists according to the descriptions of aims contained in the Degree Ordinance. A good reception of children who are abused requires that healthcare staff possess knowledge of children’s normal development. Only those who have such knowledge can be expected to react to deviations from normality.</p>
<p>We propose  that negotiations be commenced with the healthcare principals at the earliest opportunity regarding the development of routines in healthcare services. It is essential for the healthcare principals to devise routines of these kinds and train the staff in the same. Child-abuse cases are not particularly common in the healthcare sector, and staff are therefore unable to acquire specific experience of managing them. At the same time, it is paramount for the right measures to be taken and the case to be dealt with promptly. Good case management therefore presupposes routines at the workplace whereby the employee is given clear directives on which measures should be taken, and in which order, in response to child abuse.</p>
<h2>Chapter 10. Psychological reactions and treatment in the event of child abuse</h2>
<p>Access to prompt and expert support and treatment measures may be crucial to disadvantaged children’s future quality of life. The injuries they have incurred can then heal, leaving scars, instead of always remaining open wounds.</p>
<p>Support and treatment measures for a child subjected to abuse are essential because they give healing processes a chance, and sustain and assist the child’s further development. A child who has suffered physical abuse has not only visible bodily injuries but also inner, psychological damage. Abuse is a traumatic experience that can affect a child’s whole personality, play and learning, and capacity to form relationships, and can also give rise to behavioural disturbances.</p>
<p>Witnessing violence or being subjected to mental abuse, too, is a traumatic experience that may have repercussions on the child’s further development.</p>
<h2>Chapter 11. Preventing child abuse</h2>
<p>Nowadays professionals in every field agree that preventive efforts are important, in both human and economic terms. In our view, measures of this kind should play a more prominent part in everyday work with children.</p>
<p>The studies carried out by us and others show the complexity of the background to abuse, neglect or other forms of maltreatment of children. The complex nature of background variables means that work to prevent abuse of children requires a wide-ranging approach. The introduction to this chapter is therefore a rationale of the value of general inputs. One point made is that the category of children in the risk zone is variable over time; another is that if measures are restricted to fewer children the majority of children affected are missed, even if the work is effective. There follows a rationale of the value of social-policy measures and legislation that also performs an educational function, and the importance of influencing society’s norms and values and continuing to implement the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.</p>
<p>We propose  that the scope for setting up a national centre for children at risk be investigated. In a country with high ambitions to improve conditions for children and families, it is reasonable to have a national research centre at an academic department, with advanced interdisciplinary skills relating to disadvantaged children. A national centre for children at risk should be associated with active clinical work at regional level by professionals with expertise concerning children in distress or at risk. This would afford an opportunity for an active dialogue between research and clinical practice. A centre of this kind should also engage in close cooperation with higher education institutions and keep up with current research relating to disadvantaged children.</p>
<p>A national centre for children at risk could assume responsibility for epidemiological research; carry out expert evaluations of action requirements and of both short-term and long-term treatment measures; and collect data on cases of abuse and other forms of maltreatment that are particularly complex and unusual. The ultimate purpose of the centre would be to support and help children in distress. The existence of a national centre would enhance the research value of the issues concerned, and attract the best researchers in the field. A centre of this kind would also find it relatively easy to get key issues added to both a national and a European agenda.</p>
<p>We propose  that the Government resolve to explore the scope for setting up ‘parental-support centres’. We have found that childhealth centres, schools and other authorities are in a position to support and help parents in many ways by means of their respective knowledge, but we consider that there is at present no official body with wide-ranging skills to which parents experiencing problems relating to children and adolescents can turn for help.</p>
<p>We discuss forms of preventive work involving prompt measures and support for children and adolescents, and also for families. We consider that pre-schools, schools and after-school recreation centres, just like the social and healthcare services, can play a key part in this work. Regarding the latter, we lay particular emphasis on maternal and child healthcare. In our view, the staff engaged in these activities have special responsibility for monitoring the parent-child bonding process, but also for mobilising parents’ resources when necessary.</p>
<p>We are concerned to emphasise the valuable role of pre-school play groups and family centres in preventive efforts, and also the inputs of voluntary organisations.</p>
<p>Good support and treatment measures for children subjected to abuse and other maltreatment, and also rehabilitation of perpetrators, are in various ways important components of preventive work.</p>
<p>We propose  that Statistics Sweden (SCB) be commissioned to survey, every three years, school pupils’ experience of violence in the home, at school and in leisure activities. In our view, knowledge of children’s and adolescents’ own experience and perceptions of abuse and other forms of maltreatment should be used in both preventive and remedial work.</p>
<p>The report ‘Children and Abuse’  (SOU 2001:18) finds that there is a great need both of epidemiological monitoring of children’s subjection to violence and of special studies of the particular circumstances of certain children. We propose  that SCB be commissioned to survey, every three years, parents’ experience of and attitudes towards violence against their own children. Our ‘Parental Survey 2000’ is based largely on an Academic study of 1980. In the intervening years, no similar study was carried out. In our view, such studies should be conducted more often to permit satisfactory monitoring of trends.</p>
<p>We propose  that the National Board of Health and Welfare be commissioned to issue a report every five years, in conjunction with its summary of public inquiries into children’s deaths, on wilful violence against children. Special studies of such violence, based on the register of injuries and causes of death, should be carried out at regular intervals. Information from register studies and inquiries into child deaths can yield useful knowledge that can bring about improved preventive measures and care.</p>
<h2>Chapter 12. Our outreach activities</h2>
<p>Under the directives, the Committee against Child Abuse must engage in active and outreach work. We decided to implement this assignment in three stages and engage in three entirely different information activities. Our target groups have been parents and other guardians, children and adolescents, and also occupational groups that work with children.</p>
<p>For parents and other guardians we issued A Book for Parents , in an edition of 500,000, which was mainly distributed through pharmacies, child-health centres and post offices. Many orders have been received from schools and the social services, which can use A Book for Parents  in discussions with and courses for parents. The booklet has been translated into seven languages besides English (Arabic, the two Kurdish dialects Kurmanji and Sorani, Persian, Somali, Spanish and Turkish), and is also available in a simplified Swedish version. To disseminate information about the book, a video film and a variety of other material were produced.</p>
<p>The second information campaign, entitled ‘Get a Grip’, catered for schoolchildren in the fourth to seventh years of compulsory school (aged 10–13) some 453,000 pupils altogether. Its purpose was to strengthen children’s and adolescents’ self-esteem and inform them of the means of obtaining help available in the community for children in distress or at risk. Petter and Ayo, two rap artists, wrote the text of ‘Get a Grip’ about children’s and young people’s rights. The rap song was recorded on a CD, and its wrapper also contained information on where to seek community support and help. When the material was sent out to schools, the CD was supplemented by a letter to the teacher in charge, with suggestions for using it in teaching. This CD was awarded a ‘Golden Egg’ by the Advertising Association of Sweden for the best radio advertising in the year 2000.</p>
<p>The rap song has also been recorded as a music video and shown at, for example, Svensk Film’s cinemas around the country. The campaign was conducted in close cooperation with BRIS, Save the Children Sweden, the youth sector of the Cooperation Group for Immigrant Organisations in Sweden (UngSIOS) and Unga Örnar (‘Young Eagles’, a Swedish child and youth organisation).</p>
<p>The third and last campaign, ‘Suspecting Child Abuse’, was directed at occupational groups who work with children up to the age of 10. Here, the purpose was to inform them about signs of child abuse and make them aware of their reporting obligation under Section 71 of the Social Services Act (SFS 1980:620, from 1 January 2002 Chapter 14, Section 1).</p>
<p>This information campaign comprised a CD containing dramatisations of situations that may arise in a pre-school or school; material entitled ‘Signs of Child Abuse and Neglect’; and a booklet entitled ‘Helping Children at risk’. Teachers in years 1 3 of compulsory school, school health services, pre-schools, childhabilitation services and child-health centre have received the material. Altogether, some 70,000 ‘packages’ have been distributed. Trade-union representatives at workplaces have also been informed of the material. This campaign was conducted in close cooperation with the Swedish Trade Union Confederation (LO), the Swedish Confederation of Professional Associations (SACO) and the Central Organization of Salaried Employees in Sweden (TCO).</p>
<h2>Chapter 13. Child abuse in criminal law</h2>
<p>In our estimation, neither further criminalisation of child abuse nor effecting any amendment of the provisions on sanctions for the same in the Swedish Penal Code is warranted.</p>
<p>We propose  instead that special grounds for more severe penalties be inserted into Chapter 29, Section 2 of the Swedish Penal Code for cases involving offences committed by people who are, or have previously been, close relatives of the children concerned. Under the current provisions, in the assessment of culpability, the commission of an offence against a child is to be considered an aggravating circumstance. In some cases, the circumstances in which criminal acts against children take place must be deemed doubly aggravating. Here, we are referring first and foremost to cases where the offence is perpetrated against a child who is a close relative of the accused. In these cases, the circumstances may be regarded as aggravating not only because the offence has been committed against a child in a defenceless position, but also because the child is thereby deprived of his or her security. It should also be regarded as a particularly aggravating circumstance for an offence to be perpetrated in the presence of a child who is a close relative of the victim. A common situation is for children to witness the father abusing the mother. In this case, too, the security aspect is a salient one.</p>
<p>We propose , moreover, that the prosecution provisions of Chapter 3, Section 12 and Chapter 5 of the Swedish Penal Code be amended with respect to offences against children who are close relatives of the offenders. In these cases, it should be possible for prosecution by a public prosecutor to take place if it is called for from a general point of view. Today, prosecutors are obliged to initiate a prosecution for most crimes. Nevertheless, there are a few offences relevant here that may be prosecuted only after charges have been pressed by the victim, or which may be prosecuted by the victims only. If a crime of this kind is directed against a child, the child’s guardian or a person close to the guardian must press charges or prosecute the crime. It is frequently the child’s guardian or someone close to the same who has committed the offence against the child. The guardian may therefore have no reason to assist in bringing about prosecution. In such cases, public prosecutors should be enabled to initiate the prosecution.</p>
<p>We propose , furthermore to emphasise the purpose of amending the prosecution provision in Chapter 5 of the Swedish Penal Code that the provision in Chapter 14, Section 2, paragraph five of the Secrecy Act (1980:100) be amended to permit information to be submitted to the office of the public prosecutor or police authority in the event of suspicion of an offence under Chapter 5 of the Penal Code against a person below the age of 18 years.</p>
<h2>Chapter 14. Public inquiry into a child’s death</h2>
<p>We propose  that a system of public inquiry into a child’s death be introduced on a trial basis for a three-year period, with the National Board of Health and Welfare as the principal. The Board should appoint an expert group for this assignment. We deem that there are several reasons why society should assume particular responsibility in cases where children have died as a result of violent acts by others. These crimes are particularly grave. The perpetrators are commonly parents and the victims small children. No one can give them their lives back, but a public inquiry can subsequently seek to determine what happened. This knowledge may then be used in preventive and remedial work.</p>
<p>The target group is restricted to children under the age of 18 who have died as a result of murder, manslaughter or abuse. On average, this entails some 10 12 inquiries annually. They thus include cases not only of classic child abuse, i.e. a parent’s violence against a child, but also of violence between young people. It is our view that it is important to investigate all violence with a fatal outcome against children under 18, irrespective of who the perpetrator was. If special reasons exist, public inquiries into deaths that have not led to conviction should also be conducted.</p>
<h2>Chapter 15. Rehabilitation of perpetrators in correctional treatment</h2>
<p>During the year 2001, the majority of penal institutions will be able to offer their inmates the chance to attend the ‘Support in Parenthood’ study circle. This activity caters for all clients who are parents.</p>
<p>Since 1997, the National Prison and Probation Service has been engaged in the creation of national programmes focusing on the problems of convicts. One of these programmes is entitled ‘Violence in the Family’. As things stand today, there is no section on children’s needs and development or the short-term and longterm repercussions on children who have been subjected to violence or witnessed violence in the family.</p>
<p>We propose  that the National Prison and Probation Administration be commissioned to draw up a treatment programme on children’s needs and development, and also the consequences of being subjected to violence, for example within the framework of work to develop national programmes.</p>
<p>We propose  that the National Prison and Probation Administration be made responsible for the requisite skills development of staff with respect to child abuse, in order for the treatment programme on children to have the desired effect and be properly administered.</p>
<p>We propose  that the National Prison and Probation Administration should review the scope for using its existing organisation for local planning to place offenders convicted of violence against children in existing programmes dealing with sexrelated and family violence.</p>
<h2>Chapter 16. Financial and other implications</h2>
<p>Overall, many of the proposals may be said to focus on preventive measures in the short and long term. The economic implications of such proposals are difficult to assess. With enhanced staff skills in the various activities concerned and a statutory responsibility to collaborate when children in distress are involved, the proposals should afford human, social and economic gains in the long run.</p>
<p>One proposal applying to all the various activities is skills development. However, our view is that measures of this kind may entail initial costs, but that it should also be possible for them to fit into the existing budget limits of the agencies concerned, and that they mainly consist in an explicit focus of existing in-service and further training. It is our conviction that preventive efforts, methodological development and skills enhancement will, in the long term, yield economic gains.</p>
<p>The arguments concerning the economic implications of the various proposals are reported under the respective chapter headings.</p>
<p>Collaboration</p>
<p>At present, it is difficult to predict or assess the cost implications of devising and implementing a strategy for collaboration comprising statutory responsibility and guidelines for cooperation at national and local level. This may be connected with the level of ambition. One option may be a remit for the agencies concerned to give priority, within their regular activities, to developing joint efforts.</p>
<p>Reporting to the social welfare committee</p>
<p>The proposals presented cannot be expected to entail an increase in the costs of activities on such a scale that these cannot be covered with regular funds.</p>
<p>Social services</p>
<p>Since the social services are given primary responsibility for ensuring that cooperation with the police, schools and healthcare services takes place, we propose that they too be enabled to apply for development funds for this cooperative work. We estimate the government contribution at SEK 10 million a year for two years. The activities concerned should contribute an amount equal to the government grant. In our view, such projects should be connected with some R&D unit or academic department for social work and public administration.</p>
<p>Pre-schools, schools and after-school centres</p>
<p>We propose advancement of knowledge in pre-schools, schools and after-school recreation centres to improve these institutions’ ability to perceive and support children subjected, or suspected of being subjected, to abuse. The costs of this advancement should, in our view, come within the National Agency for Education’s grant for development work in pre-school and school education.</p>
<p>We also propose that the National Agency for Education be commissioned to issue a general recommendation on the reporting obligation, scrutiny by the Agency, internal monitoring in the municipality, and supplementing the descriptions of teachertraining aims in the Degree Ordinance.</p>
<p>Healthcare services</p>
<p>Devising routines to deal with cases of child abuse and training staff in these routines entails costs for the healthcare principals. Additional funds should be paid. The question of how much should be dealt with in negotiations between the Government and the healthcare principals.</p>
<p>The other proposals made here cannot be regarded as entailing any costs that should be covered by means of special grants.</p>
<p>Preventing child abuse</p>
<p>Costs of work to prevent child abuse usually come within the existing budget of the principal concerned. However, there are two proposals those of a national centre for children at risk and parental-support centres that must first be investigated, but which will in the long term need funds to become established. It is impossible at this stage to make any detailed pronouncements on the funds they will require.</p>
<p>The chapter proposes that SCB should conduct separate studies focusing on children and parents every three years. Corresponding studies in the year 2000 cost approximately SEK 800,000.</p>
<p>Public inquiry into a child’s death</p>
<p>Our proposal that public inquiries be set up to investigate the deaths of children, with the National Board of Health and Welfare as the principal, requires an annual increment of funds for development and annual reports. We propose  that the Board receive funds annually corresponding to one full-time post, with overheads.</p>
<p>Child abuse in criminal law</p>
<p>Our proposals are not expected to occasion anything other than entirely normal costs of the activities concerned.</p>
<p>Rehabilitation of perpetrators in correctional treatment</p>
<p>We propose  that the National Prison and Probation Administration be charged with drawing up a treatment programme for perpetrators of child abuse. The introduction of such a programme should be followed by skills development for the staff concerned. We propose that the National Prison and Probation Administration should receive funds to cover the expense of developing this programme. The aggregate cost may be estimated at SEK 800,000.</p>
