<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Remit</h2>
<p>The Inquiry has had instructions to review parts of the legislation that applies to the activities of the Swedish Competition Authority with a view to making supervision in the area of competition law more effective. The terms of reference point to four different areas within which the Inquiry is asked to consider whether additional regulations need to be introduced.</p>
<p>The Inquiry is to consider whether there is reason to introduce provisions that make it possible to suspend the periods set for investigating concentrations between undertakings.</p>
<p>The Inquiry is also to analyse the Swedish leniency programme and examine whether there is a need for provisions on a marker system, i.e. a possibility for undertakings to obtain an extension of the time allowed to provide sufficient information to be considered for immunity from or reduction of an administrative fine (leniency).</p>
<p>In addition, the Inquiry is to consider whether a need exists for regulations regarding the working procedures of the Swedish Competition Authority when it copies digitally stored material from an undertaking for examination outside the undertaking’s premises.</p>
<p>The Inquiry is also to investigate whether the needs of the Swedish Competition Authority for cooperation in targeted inspections are adequately met by the current legal regulations or whether the rules need to be clarified or supplemented.</p>
<h2>Organisation of the report</h2>
<p>Chapter 2  contains an overview of the relevant provisions of Swedish competition law and EU legal provisions.</p>
<p>Chapter 3  discusses the need for the Swedish Competition Authority to have option of suspending the periods set for examining concentrations.</p>
<p>Chapter 4  discusses the issue of a marker system in the Swedish leniency programme.</p>
<p>Chapter 5  considers whether the Swedish Competition Authority should be allowed to examine digitally stored material on its own premises in connection with targeted inspections. This chapter also discusses the issue of whether requirements on undertakings to cooperate in targeted inspections need to be clarified.</p>
<p>Chapter 6  discusses issues of entry into force and transitional provisions.</p>
<p>Chapter 7  describes the expected consequences of the Inquiry’s proposals.</p>
<h2>The Inquiry’s deliberations and proposals</h2>
<p>‘Stopping the clock’ in investigations of concentrations between undertakings</p>
<p>One of the tasks of the Swedish Competition Authority is to examine notified cases of concentrations between undertakings of a certain size and take action against concentrations that risk significantly restraining the occurrence or the development of effective competition. Examinations of concentrations must be made within a certain statutory period, as a result of which they are often carried out under severe time pressure. To be able to carry out the examination, the Swedish Competition Authority is dependent on undertakings providing information. If the undertakings do not promptly provide correct and complete information, the Authority can run short of time, which may adversely affect the quality of the investigation.</p>
<p>The European Commission and several EU Member States have the option of suspending examination periods in cases where</p>
<p>undertakings fail to provide the information requested in time or if the information is inadequate or erroneous. In such cases the period can be suspended until correct information is provided. This is known as ‘stopping the clock’.</p>
<p>In recent years, economic analysis has played an increasingly prominent part in the application of the law at EU level, particularly in examinations of concentrations. The call for economic analysis has also increased in concentration cases examined by the Swedish Competition Authority, as Swedish cases must be assessed in the same way as in the EU. The Swedish Competition Authority obtains extensive information from the parties concerned for the purpose of economic analysis.</p>
<p>The Inquiry gives examples of situations where the option of stopping the clock would have been desirable. The Inquiry has concluded that the current option for the Swedish Competition Authority to extend examination periods is inadequate and that an option of suspending the periods could lead to more effective investigations and enhance the quality of the Authority’s decisions.</p>
<p>As a result of its deliberations, the Inquiry has concluded that a provision is needed in the Competition Act to enable the Swedish</p>
<p>Competition Authority to ‘stop the clock’ in concentration examinations. The Inquiry therefore proposes the introduction of such a provision and that this option should be available both in the initial investigation (phase 1) and in the special investigation (phase 2). The Authority should be able to order a suspension when notifying parties have not complied with a request to provide information that the Authority needs to be able to conduct an analysis that is relevant to the concentration examination.</p>
<p>It has also emerged in the course of the Inquiry that there may also be a need for the undertakings to be allowed to provide additional information during phase 1 without this affecting the examination period. The Inquiry therefore proposes that the Swedish Competition Authority also be able to stop the clock during phase 1 at the request of the undertaking that has given notification of the concentration.</p>
<p>Leniency means that the undertaking that is first to reveal participation in anti-competitive cooperation can get full immunity from fines. Leniency is an important tool for exposing cartels and other anti-competitive cooperation between undertakings. Only one of the undertakings in a cartel can obtain leniency.</p>
<p>Sweden has had rules on leniency since 2002 and all EU countries now have rules on leniency for undertakings that disclose their participation in a cartel. To facilitate harmonisation of the various EU countries’ leniency programmes, the European</p>
<p>Competition Network (ECN), a network consisting of national competition authorities and the European Commission, has drawn up a Model Leniency Programme.</p>
<p>The Model Programme, like almost all national leniency programmes and the Commission’s leniency programme, contains a possibility for undertakings that want to apply for leniency to first provide a limited amount of information and apply for a</p>
<p>‘marker’. A marker guarantees the undertaking’s place in the queue for a given period of time. During this period, the undertaking is allowed to gather sufficient information to meet the requirements for leniency without risking another undertaking doing so first. The Swedish leniency provisions do not contain any such possibility for the Swedish Competition Authority to grant undertakings an extension of the time allowed to submit information and evidence.</p>
<p>The Inquiry considers there is reason to introduce a marker system in the Swedish leniency programme. A marker system makes it easier for undertakings to withdraw from prohibited cooperation and therefore helps to make cartels more unstable. By giving undertakings time to collect evidence and complete an application without risking another undertaking completing its application first, a marker system leads to higher quality applications, which facilitates the further investigation by the Swedish Competition Authority. No real arguments against introducing such a system have come to light.</p>
<p>Securing of evidence in targeted inspections</p>
<p>When the Swedish Competition Authority carries out a targeted inspection, it makes copies of both paper documents and digitally stored material. To be able to search effectively and securely for evidence in digitally stored material, the Authority make forensic images of the material during its visit to the undertaking, using forensic software. This also makes it possible to find erased material. Once the material has been indexed, it can be searched using search words.</p>
<p>As it can often take several weeks to search the digital material, during a number of targeted inspections in recent years the Swedish Competition Authority has chosen to make forensic copies the digital material on the undertaking’s premises and then conduct indexing, searching and selection of the material on its own premises. There are no special legal regulations on the respective rights of the Authority and the undertaking regarding this procedure.</p>
<p>The Inquiry has reviewed the conditions for the Swedish Competition Authority to carry out indexing and searching on the undertaking’s premises and on its own premises, and has compared the procedures used with those of other European competition authorities and other Swedish authorities with similar investigative powers. Having done this, the Inquiry has concluded that allowing the Swedish Competition Authority to carry out indexing and searching of digital material on its own premises will contribute to more effective investigations. However, the undertaking should be able to have the decision reviewed by appealing against the decision of the district court in this respect.</p>
<p>Requirements on undertakings in targeted inspections</p>
<p>The Inquiry has also been asked to investigate whether the needs of the Swedish Competition Authority for cooperation from undertakings in targeted inspections are adequately met by the current legal regulations or whether the rules need to be clarified or supplemented in any respect.</p>
<p>The Inquiry has concluded here that although the Competition Act does not contain any explicit requirement for undertakings that are the object of targeted inspections to cooperate with the</p>
<p>Swedish Competition Authority, an obligation for undertakings to cooperate is nonetheless indirectly evident in the Act. The undertakings’ obligation may be considered to consist in the fact that they must make it possible for the Swedish Competition Authority to carry out targeted inspections in accordance with the</p>
<p>Authority’s powers under Chapter 5, Section 6 of the Competition Act. This obligation is sufficiently extensive that it may be considered to cover the assistance from the undertakings that the Authority needs. The Inquiry therefore does not propose any regulations in this respect.</p>
<p>Consequences of the proposals</p>
<p>The Inquiry does not expect the proposals to have any significant financial consequences either for undertakings or for the public authorities. The proposals are expected to increase the effectiveness of the Swedish Competition Authority’s concentration examinations, leniency applications and targeted inspections. The proposed possibility of ‘stopping the clock’ in concentration examinations will help the Authority to obtain the material and give it the time it needs to carry out relevant analyses, which is expected to result in the Authority’s concentration examinations being of higher quality. The proposed introduction of a marker system can be expected to contribute to increased effectiveness in exposing prohibited cooperation between undertakings. The proposal to allow digital material to be examined on the Authority’s premises also aims to increase the effectiveness of targeted inspections, which can be expected to make it easier for the Authority to find evidence of, and take legal action against, infringements of competition law. Overall, the Inquiry considers that the proposals will have positive consequences for the economy and, ultimately, for consumers.</p>
