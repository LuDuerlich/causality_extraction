<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>The commission</h2>
<p>Our principal task has been not only to produce a basis for a decision as to whether Sweden should accede to the revised version of the European Patent Convention (EPC 2000), the Agreement on the application of Article 65 of the EPC (the ”London Agreement”) and the Patent Law Treaty (PLT), but also to suggest proposals for changes in legislation that would be necessary for accession, as well as any changes that would be appropriate in the context. The commission also includes submitting proposed changes in legislation in the light of amendments that have been made in the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT). Finally we have been instructed to consider the issue of enhanced protection of confidentiality for intellectual property advisers, as well as a few specific issues concerning the administration of patent applications.</p>
<h2>EPC (Section 3)</h2>
<h2>Ratification of EPC 2000</h2>
<p>One of the objectives of a revision of the EPC has been to make the framework more flexible. This has been achieved, inter alia, by transferring a large number of provisions from the articles to the implementing regulations. A particular empowering provision authorizes the Administrative Council of the European Patent Organization to take decisions on new or amended implementing regulations, without having to convene a diplomatic conference. This also applies to amendments of certain articles, insofar as the purpose is to bring them into line with an international treaty relating to patents or European Community legislation in the field of patents. This open-ended arrangement has obvious advantages, but will also make an overview of the future developments of the framework more difficult. In spite of these reservations, we consider that non-ratification by Sweden would be inconceivable, since Sweden would then have to withdraw from European patent cooperation, which in its turn would have serious consequences for Swedish industry. In this context we have expressed doubts whether it is even possible for a Member State of the EU not to participate in the EPC cooperation. We therefore propose that Sweden should ratify EPC 2000.</p>
<h2>Changes in the Swedish Patent Act as a result of EPC 2000</h2>
<p>1. Petition for review under 112a EPC 2000</p>
<p>The current text of the EPC (EPC 1973) includes no proviso for setting aside a decision taken by a Board of Appeal within the European Patent Office (EPO). By means of a new Article 112a, a procedure has been introduced, allowing the Enlarged Board of Appeal to set aside and remit a decision under extraordinary circumstances. The presumption is that grave procedural defects have occurred in the appeal proceedings, or that a criminal act of a certain gravity may have had an impact on the decision. In a particular provision it states that any person who has, in the period between the decision of the Board of Appeal and publication of the decision of the Enlarged Board of Appeal on the petition for review, in good faith used or made effective and serious preparations for using an invention, may continue such use. We propose that a corresponding provision be incorporated into section 92 of the Swedish Patent Act (PL). 2. Administrative procedure for limitation and revocation of patents</p>
<p>The Patent Litigation Commission of 1999 has in its report (SOU 2001:33) submitted proposals for a Swedish procedure on patent limitation. That proposal is based primarily on new provisions in Articles 105a – 105c EPC 2000 concerning patent limitation by means of a decision taken by the EPO. The proposal referred to, which for all intents and purposes forms the basis of what we now propose, entails the following: The holder of a patent shall be solely entitled to request limitation. Such a request shall be examined on formal grounds only and on the premise that claims as amended constitute limitation of the original (or previously limited) claims. A decision on limitation shall apply retroactively as from the filing date of the application (ex tunc). A request for limitation shall be rejected where opposition proceedings or invalidity proceedings are pending. Moreover a procedure for limitation pending with the EPO shall have precedence over a national procedure in the sense that the latter procedure should be stayed pending a decision by the EPO, irrespective of which procedure was first initiated. According to the proposal, the holder of a patent would in infringement or invalidity cases be obliged to inform the court of any administrative limitation procedures pending.</p>
<p>According to Article 138(3) EPC 2000 the patent holder shall in court proceedings relating to invalidity have the right to limit the patent by amending the claims. It is proposed that a corresponding provision be included in section 52 PL.</p>
<p>In addition to the recommendations of the Patent Litigation Commission, we propose that the holder of a patent, in line with Article 105a EPC 2000, should be entitled to request that a patent should be revoked in its entirety, with retroactive effect as from the filing date of the application. We have not found any reasons to do away with the current possibility for abstaining from a patent under section 54 PL, with effect for the future (ex nunc). Consequently the patent holder will be able to opt for any one of these procedures, given the circumstances in a particular case. However, we propose that a voluntary abstention in accordance with section 54 PL should only apply to the patent in its entirety. This should be expressly stated in the provision.</p>
<p>We also propose certain amendments of Chapter 11 of the Swedish Patent Act for the purpose of extending the necessary legal effect in Sweden from an EPO decision on limitation or revocation of a patent. 3. Methods for treatment by surgery or therapy etc.</p>
<p>According to Article 52(4) EPC 1973 certain methods for treatment by surgery or therapy and diagnostic methods shall not be regarded as inventions, due to which provision such methods have been once and for all excluded from patentability. Section 1 subsection 3 PL contains a corresponding provision. In EPC 2000 the fiction that these methods are not to be regarded as inventions has been abandoned. Nonetheless, according to Article 53(c) EPC 2000, patents shall not be granted in respect of such methods. This systematic change does not entail any inherent change with respect to patentability exemption, and amendments of Swedish legislation are not indispensable. We have nevertheless considered it appropriate to harmonise the national provisions with those of EPC 2000. This calls for a change in section 1 PL. 4. Patentability for new specific use of known medical products</p>
<p>According to Article 54(5) EPC 1973 a specific novelty exemption is to apply with regard to substances and compositions, intended for use in methods for treatment of the human or animal body by surgery or therapy and diagnostic methods practised on the human or animal body. The purport has been that already known substances or compositions are patentable only where the use thereof was not comprised in the state of the art. Thus the inventor of a certain medical use of a known substance or composition could obtain a patent. However, according to the wording of the provision there was no scope for patenting a known substance for a subsequently discovered use. In EPC 2000 a new paragraph has been added to Article 54, allowing a patent to be granted for known medical products also when the use relates to other medical indications than those for which a patent has already been granted. The fourth sub-section of current section 2 PL entails the same restriction, concerning patents for new medical use, as those provided for in Article 54(5) EPC 1973. As this limitation has now been discarded in EPC 2000, there is in our opinion no reason to retain section 2 sub-section 4 PL. We propose that Swedish legislation be harmonised by deleting the current provision in the Swedish Patent Act. 5. The right for a patent attorney to refuse to reveal confidential information</p>
<p>In article 134a and Rule 101a EPC 2000 provisions have been included, according to which members of the Institute of Professional Representatives before the EPO (epi) shall not be obliged to reveal confidential professional information in proceedings before the EPO. These provisions do not necessitate any changes in Swedish legislation, but are directly linked to the particular issue of patent attorney confidentiality which we are to consider in accordance with our terms of reference. We deal with this matter in Section 7. 6. EPC 2000 amendments resulting from PLT</p>
<p>A number of changes have been made in EPC 2000 in order to ensure conformity between the convention and the provisions of the PLT. These amendments relate, inter alia, to the prerequisites for granting a patent application a filing date, the right to extension of time limits and the reinstatement of priority rights. As far as the extension of time limits is concerned, the provisions of Article 121 EPC 2000 go further than the PLT requires. We have chosen to deal with this matter in Section 5 since this concerns bringing Sweden into line with the Patent Law Treaty.</p>
<h2>The London Agreement (Section 4)</h2>
<h2>Ratification of the London Agreement</h2>
<p>The purpose of the London Agreement is to reduce the costs that result from requirements that a European patent must be translated if it is to be valid in the designated states. The Agreement is not mandatory and may be acceded to by those EPC states that wish to do so. The Agreement has been construed in order to ensure that exemptions from the translation requirement can be implemented at the same time in a certain number of states. By accession to the Agreement, each state undertakes to abandon translation requirements entirely or in part. In practice this means that those states whose official languages are one of the EPO official languages, completely abstain from requiring a translation of the patent. Other member states, that do not have English, French or German as their official languages, are to choose one of the EPO official languages and dispense from requiring translation of the patent description if the patent has been granted in or translated into the language designated. Even when the patent specification is in that language, these states shall still have the right to require translation of the claims into one of their national languages.</p>
<p>According to our assessment, it can not be ruled out that a Swedish ratification of the London Agreement might have a certain negative impact, primarily on the patent attorney profession but also, to some extent, on third parties. On the other hand we found no grounds for expecting any but marginal consequences for the maintenance and development of the Swedish language. Any fears that conditions would deteriorate as far as the development of Swedish terminology is concerned has been contradicted by information from the Swedish Centre for Terminology (TNC), indicating that translated patent documents have been hardly ever used in terminology work. It is also relevant to note that translations are often produced a long time after an invention has been made public. There is very little demand for those translations kept at the Swedish Patent and Registration Office, and this in itself makes the texts less suitable for the introduction of new terminology and the dissemination of technology.</p>
<p>We have therefore concluded that there are compelling arguments for Sweden to ratify the London Agreement, especially in view of the stimulus to the patent system which a reduction of the patenting costs should result in. Sweden should choose English as the language from which additional translations of patent descriptions shall not be required. However, the opportunity should be used to require mandatory translation of claims into Swedish.</p>
<h2>Changes in national legislation as a result of the London</h2>
<h2>Agreement</h2>
<p>The ratification of the London Agreement calls for amendments of section 82 PL, where the new translation requirements must be incorporated.</p>
<p>The London Agreement contains an express reminder that member states have the right to require a full translation of the European patent when a dispute relating to the patent has arisen. In order to facilitate matters for the courts, we are of the opinion that this should be regulated in a new section 68 a of the Swedish Patent Act.</p>
<h2>PLT (Section 5)</h2>
<h2>Ratification of the PLT</h2>
<p>The PLT entails undertakings to provide for deregulation and a certain harmonization of provisions concerning formalities to be observed on filing patent applications. The treaty primarily contains minimum requirements. Only to a very limited extent are the provisions binding on the contracting states, namely the issue of establishing a filing date and, in certain cases, matters concerning the form and content of applications.</p>
<p>Both the EPC and the PCT have been revised in order to bring them into line with the PLT. Our understanding is that it would it be unthinkable for Sweden to chose not to participate in this worldwide patent cooperation. We therefore propose that Sweden should ratify the PLT.</p>
<h2>Changes in national legislation as a result of the PLT</h2>
<p>As far as Sweden is concerned there is relatively little need for changes in legislation in order to enable ratification of the treaty. The administrative practice employed by the Swedish Patent and Registration Office is, to all intents and purposes, in agreement with the provisions on filing date in Article 5 PLT. In spite of this conformity, we consider it justified to propose two new provisions, sections 8 b and 8 c, in which the obligatory PLT provisions are reproduced.</p>
<p>Our examination of Article 11 PLT on relief in respect of time limits has led us to conclude that amendments of the Swedish Patent Act are not indispensable for the purpose of implementation. The reason for this is that those time limits that might be relevant under the Article either are already subject to the right of further processing (cf. in particular section 15 PL), or may be exempted from application of the Article, due to the fact that the periods are fixed by law. We have therefore deemed it neither necessary nor justified to adjust Swedish legislation to the more farreaching regime for extension of time limits applicable under Article 121 EPC 2000.</p>
<p>In contrast we consider amendments of section 72 PL necessary for implementation of Articles 12 and 13 PLT, which relate to the reinstatement of expired time limits in extraordinary cases. The</p>
<p>PLT requires that the current special provision with respect to the payment of annual fees should be covered by the generally applicable provision of section 72 PL and that the time should be computed from the expiry of the extended time limit referred to in section 41 sub-section 3 PL. A significant novelty is that under certain circumstances it shall be possible to have the priority right restored during a short period following the expiry of the priority year. This PLT provision should also be expressed in section 72 PL.</p>
<p>We also propose changes in section 6 a PL, as a consequence of Article 13 PLT. The purport would then be that the applicant will be granted the opportunity to make a priority claim at a later time than is presently allowed, normally within 16 months from the priority date. The applicant will also be entitled to provide for the correction or addition of a priority claim within the same period of time. In practice, a completely new priority claim can be made. It is proposed that the same shall apply to international applications, only that the entering into force of the amendment in this respect must await a planned corresponding amendment to Rule 26 bis  PCT.</p>
<h2>PCT (Section 6)</h2>
<p>In recent years several changes have been made to the PCT and its implementing regulations. One of these changes is intended to simplify the formality requirements applied when a person other than the inventor is applying for a patent. The purport is that there should no longer be a routine requirement that the applicant must produce evidence for his right to the invention. In principle a unilateral declaration of the transfer should be sufficient. This new procedure directly contradicts section 8 PL and requires an amendment of that provision. We propose that the applicant shall merely be required to state the grounds for his right to the invention. The Patent Office shall accept this information except where it may reasonably doubt the veracity of the indication presented. According to our proposal the Patent Office shall send a notification concerning the patent application to the stated inventor, unless it is obviously unnecessary to do so.</p>
<p>An additional change, in section 31 PL, is caused by new PCT provisions on extended time limit for entering into the national phase of an international application. We propose that the time limit be extended to 31 months, whether or not the applicant has requested international preliminary examination within 19 months from the priority date.</p>
<h2>Enhanced protection for patent attorney’s professional secrecy (Section 7)</h2>
<p>In Sweden, attorneys, being members of the bar (“advokat”), may not be heard as witnesses in court proceedings, concerning information which has been entrusted to them in connection with an assignment, other than to the extent permitted by law or with the consent by the person benefiting from the confidentiality. This also applies to the obligation to produce documents when a court order to that effect has been issued. A patent attorney, and any other adviser in matters of intellectual property who is not an “advokat”, has a more limited exemption from the duty to testify or produce documents. The exemption then applies only with respect to confidential information obtained during the time when the patent attorney was acting as a representative or counsel in court proceedings, and can not be invoked for information given to the patent attorney before a case has been brought before the court. The legal situation is different elsewhere in the world. US patent attorneys, regardless of what form their employment may take, normally benefit from an attorney-client privilege. In contrast, foreign patent attorneys involved in US litigation may only invoke the privilege not to reveal information where a corresponding degree of confidentiality applies in the patent attorney’s homeland. Since this is not the case in Sweden, the consequence might be that Swedish companies, involved in patent cases of economic significance, could be obliged to reveal information, via a Swedish representative, that an American counterpart is permitted to keep confidential. The difference in secrecy legislation may thus prove damaging to Swedish commercial interests.</p>
<p>The matter received attention in conjunction with the revision of EPC. As a result provisions have been incorporated into Article 134a and Rule 101a EPC 2000 granting patent attorneys the right to refuse to reveal confidential information in proceedings before the EPO. The ultimate aim of the provision is to give epi - representatives the same degree of protection of confidentiality in legal disputes in the USA as that enjoyed by attorneys domiciled there. When we have discussed any reasons for strengthening protection of confidentiality for Swedish patent advisers, we have questioned whether the changes in the EPC are sufficient to grant epi-representatives the intended protection in the USA. There seems to be no guarantee that the new Attorney evidentiary privilege provided for in Rule 101a EPC 2000 would be respected in the competent courts of EPC member states. That would probably require the national legislation to offer an equivalent degree of protection of professional confidentiality. It appears to us to be a matter of urgency that the provisions on evidentiary privilege agreed upon by the EPC member states should be fully reflected in national law, in order for US courts to respect the professional confidentiality of European representatives. This has given us sufficient reason to propose an extension of the protection of confidentiality enjoyed by advisers in patent matters. Such protection should be expressed by means of an addition to Chapter 36, section 5 of the Swedish Code of Judicial Procedure. The proposed change should apply not only to Swedish epi - representatives, but to all persons who have duly qualified themselves for the privilege.</p>
<p>Enhanced protection of confidentiality should be granted to those who in a professional capacity offer advice in matters of patent law, both as employees and as independent advisers. In our opinion, a basic prerequisite must be that those entitled to an exemption from the obligation to testify can be easily distinguished. Since it must also be a basic requirement that the persons in question have proved themselves worthy of the privilege, we have considered it inevitable that a special voluntary authorization scheme must be introduced. It is beyond our terms of reference to consider how such a scheme should be constructed in detail. We propose that the matter should be the subject of further deliberations, but by way of guidance for such an inquiry we have drafted a blueprint for a special Act on the authorization of patent attorneys. We believe that as minimum requirements for authorization, patent attorneys should demonstrate a certain level of knowledge, they should have pledged themselves to act in the best interests of their clients and they should be obliged to observe professional secrecy. Any breach of this should result in disciplinary measures. The registration and supervision of registered patent attorneys should be entrusted to a special public authority. Our draft law on the authorisation of patent attorneys is enclosed as annex 11 to this report.</p>
<h2>Some additional issues (Section 8)</h2>
<h2>Opposition fee</h2>
<p>We have been instructed to consider a proposal by the Swedish Patent and Registration Office that a special opposition fee should be payable. However, we have not found sufficient grounds to make any proposal to this effect.</p>
<h2>Post-dating of filing date</h2>
<p>We propose that the provisions in section 14 PL on post-dating of filing date be deleted, in line with what has been previously implemented in other Nordic countries.</p>
<h2>Empowering provision</h2>
<p>Our commission has included instructions to review the provision in the Patent Act for empowering normative functions. We have found no reason to depart from the proposal submitted by the Patent Litigation Commission concerning new wording of the first sub-section of section 77 PL.</p>
