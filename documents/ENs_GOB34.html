<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Terms of reference</h2>
<p>The Terms of Reference of the Committee include the analysis of the legal and objective pre-conditions for a national law authorisation for Swedish competition authorities and courts to apply directly Articles 85.1 and 86 (now Articles 81.1 and 82) of the EC Treaty in connection with the consideration of matters connected thereto. If the Committee does not identify substantial obstacles to the introduction of such powers, it should submit a proposal for statutory rules to facilitate the effective application of the Articles now in question. The Committee shall, according to the Terms of Reference, analyse in particular the extent to which the current rules in the Competition Act applicable to procedure, investigations, sanctions, etc. can be applied and are suitable for the new purpose.</p>
<h2>Structure of the report</h2>
<p>Chapter 2  contains a description of the EC’s competition rules for enterprises. The description basically comprises the provisions relating to procedure, sanctions, etc. These sections also contain a brief description of the substantive rules.</p>
<p>Chapter 3  contains a corresponding description of the Swedish competition rules. The description has, like the section on EC competition law, concentrated on rules of procedure, sanctions, etc. but also contains a brief description of the substantive rules.</p>
<p>Chapter 4  contains a description of the competition law in the other EEA countries. The centre of gravity has also in this connection been placed on the rules concerning procedure, sanctions, etc.</p>
<p>A description is given in Chapter 5  of various forms of collaboration in the field of competition. The chapter contains a general description of various forms of collaboration but also a description of two notifications that the Commission has presented, one relating to collaboration with national courts and the other relating to collaboration with national competition authorities. This chapter also reports on the White Paper that the Commission presented in April 1999 concerning the reform of the application of Articles 85 and 86 (now Articles 81 and 82) of the EC Treaty. The White Paper contains very extensive proposed amendments as regards the application of these Articles. The EU Member States and other interested parties have expressed their views on the White Paper. The chapter contains a brief description of the views expressed by the Swedish Government on the White Paper, together with views expressed by some of the EU Member States and a number of industry organisations. A detailed description of these views is contained in</p>
<p>Appendix 5.</p>
<p>The deliberations of the Committee are included in Chapter 6 . The consequences of the Committee’s proposal are reported in Chapter 7 . A commentary on the legislation is contained in Chapter 8.</p>
<h2>Deliberations of the Committee</h2>
<p>In order to establish whether there are objective or legal impediments to authorising Swedish competition authorities to apply directly Articles 81 and 82, the Committee has directed its work at comparing EC competition law with Swedish competition rules. The Committee has not found any reason to reject a national authorisation to apply EC law.</p>
<p>However, the analysis has shown that there are differences between EC law and Swedish law as regards the rules relating to procedure, sanctions, etc. The Committee was thus faced with the question of whether these differences call for an amendment of the Swedish rules. In the view of the Committee, it is an important issue that the same rules of procedure, sanctions, etc. shall apply, irrespective of whether the substantive rules to be applied are those of EC law or Swedish competition law.</p>
<p>In the course of the work, the Committee observed the power to apply Articles 81 and 82 at national level contained in Article 84 of the EC Treaty. This power, which also comprises the application of Article 81.3, is not mentioned in the Terms of Reference to the Committee. However, following deliberations with the Ministry of Industry and Trade it was decided that the Committee should also investigate that matter.</p>
<p>Substantive rules</p>
<p>The substantive rules of Swedish competition law have EC law as a model. The substantive statutory rules are also interpreted against the background of the case law that has been developed by the ECJ and Court of First Instance. However, there are certain substantive differences between the Competition Act and the EC competition rules. These differences may complicate application of the law by Swedish authorities but, in the view of the Committee, they do not mean that a national application of the EC competition rules should not be introduced.</p>
<p>Procedural rules</p>
<p>The Committee considers that it is clear that the Swedish Competition Authority ( Konkurrensverket ) should be the national authority to be entrusted with the functions that lie with the Commission at the EC level. Both the Commission and the Competition Authority have a great scope to determine whether or not there should be an intervention in the individual case. The procedural rules that are then applied to a pending matter broadly correspond with each other. However, there are also some differences between the procedural rules applied under EC law and the procedural rules that are applied in matters under the Competition Act.</p>
<p>The Committee has deliberated upon whether the provisions of the Competition Act on notification of negative clearance  should also apply as regards Articles 81 and 82 of the EC Treaty. However, such a notification has no effect outside Sweden and does not prevent the Commission or another national competition authority intervening against the practice or contract questioned. The Committee considers that it is not justified to place the additional tasks on the Competition Authority that would flow from an authorisation to issue notifications of negative clearance pursuant to EC competition law.</p>
<p>The Commission has, leaving aside certain particular cases, the exclusive right to apply the provision concerning exemptions in Article 81.3  of the EC Treaty. In these particular cases, the Competition Authority should be authorised to grant exemptions. However, according to the view of the Committee, the authorisation of the Competition Authority and the Market Court to decide on exemptions in accordance with Article 81.3 should not be limited to those situations currently permitted according to EC law. This authorisation proposed by the Committee has been formulated generally. Consequently, it is ultimately</p>
<p>EC law that sets the limits for the competence of Swedish authorities in this respect. This may have particular importance in the perspective of those proposals that are presented in the Commission’s White Paper. However, the Committee has assessed that the rules concerning so-called automatic exemption in Sections 13 and 14 of the Competition Act should not apply as regards exemptions according to EC law. Rules have also been introduced into the proposal concerning appeals against decisions made by the Competition Authority that a block exemption regulation under EC law should not apply in a particular case.</p>
<p>The Committee has concluded that the rules of the Competition Act concerning the duty to provide information and investigations  are based on corresponding provisions in EC law. In the view of the Committee, there are no substantial differences between the systems of rules in this respect, even if there are differences, inter alia, as regards so-called extended prohibitions and the special right to take action in Section 23, second paragraph of the Competition Act. Even as regards measures against the prohibited restrictive trade practices , the systems of rules have great similarities with each other. It has been observed that there are some differences as regards the possibility of obtaining indemnity for litigation costs.  However, the Committee considers both that the applicable Swedish rules may be applied even in an EC law context, and that the other differences do not impede the effective application of EC law.</p>
<p>The Committee has concluded that the conditions for the imposition of sanctions  in the event of violations of EC law should be the same, irrespective of whether EC law or the Competition Act is applied. However, there are certain differences as regards the bases for computation of fines under EC law and the competition damage penalty under the Competition Act respectively. However, the Committee has concluded that it should be possible to apply the same principles for computation of the quantum of the competition damage penalty (konkurrensskadeavgift) irrespective of whether the issue involves a violation of EC law or the Competition Act.</p>
<p>The Committee recommends that the rule applicable for the Commission on matters of international authorisation  should be applicable even when the Competition Authority shall apply EC competition law. However, in the opinion of the Committee, both reasons of principle and practice speak for that the Authority should primarily intervene against practices that are closely linked to Sweden.</p>
<p>There are no generally applicable secrecy rules  within the EU. The Committee has concluded that certain problems may arise in conjunction with international exchange of information but that it is not possible to submit unilaterally any proposal that solves these problems at national level. A national authorisation to apply Articles 81 and 82 of the EC Treaty does not, in the opinion of the Committee, mean that the Swedish secrecy provisions need to be amended. However, if the thoughts of the Commission in the White Paper are realised, the situation may change. The Committee has also made the assessment that, at this time, it is not necessary to introduce a provision concerning the duty of the Competition Authority to inform the Committee of pending matters with EC law implications.</p>
<p>The Committee has concluded that a decision of a national authority, for example, the Competition Authority, does not have any legal effects  outside the territory of its own country. However, decisions of the Commission, to varying extents, have legal effects throughout the entire Community. For obvious reasons, the Committee has not been able to submit any proposals concerning the legal effects of Swedish decisions in other countries.</p>
<p>The Committee has, as regards the question of enforcement , concluded that a decision by the Commission concerning fines or periodic penalty payments are enforceable in the Member States. A corresponding decision at national level can, in the absence of international treaties, only be enforced within the territory of the country itself.</p>
<p>At present, the right to damages  on the grounds of a violation of EC competition law is probably dependent upon the application of national law. This means that if national law affords an opportunity to obtain damages in the event of a contravention of a national competition statute, the contravention of an EC competition provision shall apply mutatis mutandis . Sweden is one of few Member States in the EU that has special legal provisions on the right to damages on the grounds of violation of competition laws, even if there are probably such rights under most of the national legal systems in the EU. It is not absolutely necessary, according to the Committee, to have any express statutory provision concerning the right to damages in the event of violation of Articles 81 and 82 of the EC Treaty. Furthermore, the EC courts have developed certain principles concerning the law on damages. This legal development is still continuing. In the view of the Committee, it would therefore be unfortunate to introduce statutory provisions concerning the right to damages in connection with a violation of Article 81.1 or 82.</p>
<h2>The proposal of the Committee</h2>
<p>The Committee has not identified any major impediments to the introduction of a national application of Articles 81 and 82 of the EC Treaty. It is proposed that the central provision concerning national application of these provisions be introduced in the Act on Application of European Community Competition and Government Subsidy Rules (1994:1845). The Act currently contains, inter alia , provisions concerning the measures that the competent authority (the Competition Authority) may implement in conjunction with an investigation being conducted at the request of the EC Commission.</p>
<p>The amendment proposed means, inter alia,  that the Competition Authority may apply Articles 81 and 82 of the EC Treaty. The amendment also means that the Market Court and Stockholm City Court, when considering matters connected with such application by the Authority, may apply Articles 81 and 82. The rules of the Competition Act apply to the investigations, sanctions, etc.</p>
<p>As indicated by the section on the deliberations of the Committee, the Committee does not consider that it is necessary to alter the Competition Act, except that it is proposed to introduce a reference to the Act on the Application of European Community Competition and Government Subsidy Rules (1994:1845) into Section 5 of the Competition Act. It is proposed that a corresponding reference be introduced into the Market Court Act (1970:417).</p>
<p>It is proposed that the statutory amendments enter into force on 1 January 2001. The rules of EC competition law already apply substantively in Sweden at this date. The statutory rules that the Committee propose do not affect the substantive validity of these rules. The Committee considers that it is not necessary to have any transitional provisions as regards the competence of the Competition Authority to apply EC competition rules. However, it is proposed that it should not be possible to impose the competition damage penalty for violation of EC competition law, to the extent that the matter relates to circumstances existing before the entry into force of the proposed rules.</p>
<h2>Consequences of the proposal</h2>
<p>In the opinion of the Committee, the proposal does not have any major economic implications. A national application of Articles 81 and 82 of the EC Treaty may be expected to increase effectiveness in the application of these rules and in this way have a positive effect on the national economy.</p>
<p>As regards the Competition Authority, the proposal probably does not involve any extensive consequences, even if some need for training of staff is probably to be expected. If the Authority is authorised to apply EC law directly, this will probably also mean that some matters become more complicated and require further resources to be able to deal with them. It is at present unusual for the Commission to transfer matters to national competition authorities. However, it is not possible to anticipate the extent to which the Commission may, in the future, wish to transfer matters to national authorities.</p>
<p>To summarise, the Committee considers that the proposal does not involve any immediate need for increased resources on the part of the Competition Authority. The Authority should be able to deal with matters concerning the application of EC law by redistribution of resources within the authority. The corresponding assessment has been made as regards other authorities.</p>
