<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>The Commission on Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) proposes measures and guidelines for an improved system to provide a knowledge base (data and information) for the introduction of MSP. The proposals, which should be seen as complementary to those in the main report (SOU 2010:91), are structured according to the three stages: collecting, providing and using data and information. These supplement the proposed planning process in six stages, as set out in the main report of the Commission.</p>
<p>Collect</p>
<p>The first five chapters of this report give an account of the background to the proposals in the report. Related obligations according to EU directives are described. The Commission sees the need to coordinate the knowledge base for MSP with the marine framework directive in particular, and its descriptors for good environmental status. Subsequently, an account is given of ongoing work on MSP and the knowledge base for planning in the three closest neighbouring countries, as well as of a few MSP related EU financed transnational pilot and research projects.</p>
<p>Next, a comprehensive chapter deals with existing data and information within the relevant knowledge and activity areas. We conclude that gaps remain within all areas, but that the knowledge base generally is sufficient to introduce MSP as planned. The largest knowledge gap is to be found in the field of socioeconomic knowledge. The need to develop methods is present in all areas, but is most pronounced here.</p>
<p>In addition, a number of national, EU and international initiatives that are relevant to MSP related data and information are presented, such as the EU Inspire  directive, the Swedish “Geodata” cooperation between government agencies, organisations and municipalities, and the EU initiative on a marine observation and data network, Emodnet. Finally, the legal framework for access to data and information is analysed, especially according to the Official Secrets Act.</p>
<h2>Proposals on the Collection of Data Concerning the Sea</h2>
<p>SwAM as Lead User and Coordinator</p>
<p>The Commission proposes that the Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management (SwAM) is to develop a system to collect data and information for MSP, in collaboration with the agencies concerned.</p>
<p>SwAM will have the central role as lead user and coordinator for the provision of relevant data and information for MSP. An efficient system should be set up that ensures quality and compatibility, and at the same time allows for the use of data for multiple purposes: MSP, the implementation of EU directives, international conventions, as well as other forms of environmental monitoring.</p>
<p>The commission sees great potential in coordinating the collection and processing of data, as well as the setting up of a knowledge base for MSP, with the neighbouring countries.</p>
<p>Coordinated National Surveys at Sea</p>
<p>In order to simplify and streamline the collection of sea depth data etc., it is proposed that the Swedish Maritime Administration (SMA) should coordinate all national hydrographical surveys. Together with the Geological Survey of Sweden, the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute, SwAM, the Swedish Armed Forces HQ and the Swedish National Heritage Board, the SMA should report on how to coordinate surveys at sea.</p>
<p>The Commission sees a number of advantages: Coordinated planning creates an opportunity to reduce costs and increase efficiency. Recurring tenders with a substantial budget can enable new enterprises to form and a market to develop for contractors. Survey vessels can be fitted with different kinds of surveying equipment and hence collect a number of different data simultaneously.</p>
<p>A National Survey Programme for the Sea</p>
<p>The collection of hydrographical data must be set up according to the requirements of all agencies concerned, and data providers and surveyors should be selected based on the combined requirements. We propose that the SMA should set up a national survey programme for the sea, together with all agencies concerned, in order to survey all sea areas that have not yet been covered with modern methods.</p>
<p>MSP implies partly new requirements for hydrographical data which must be coordinated with the needs in other fields. The requirements that should be met and what the priorities should be, are subjects for further inquiry. The cost of surveying the sea areas in question is considerable, and should be covered according to where the requirements arise.</p>
<p>Additional funding should be provided to the surveys of marine geology, in order to make better use of existing exploratory resources (vessels, etc.). Surveys have so far been concentrated to areas close to the coast. There is much less detailed knowledge on marine geology outside costal waters, and there is a large virtually unexplored area to the north of the island of Gotland.</p>
<p>A More Efficient Licensing Process for Surveys at Sea</p>
<p>Two proposals are put forward to simplify and streamline the licensing process for surveys at sea.</p>
<p>It is important that all relevant bathymetric data are collected and made available. All that are granted a licence to perform surveys at sea should be obligated to hand in the data to the SMA.</p>
<p>The Commission also proposes that the licensing process for surveys at sea should be simplified so that the SMA will handle all applications for hydrographical survey licenses, as well as for permissions to set up data bases for hydrographical data.</p>
<h2>Proposals Related to the Provision of a Knowledge Base for MSP</h2>
<p>Guidelines for the Provision of Data and Information</p>
<p>The Commission sets out guidelines for the cooperation between SwAM and other agencies for the purposes of MSP. The exchange of data and information should be based on the application of the EU Inspire directive and the national “geodata” strategy.</p>
<p>In addition a specific web portal for MSP should be introduced. We see the need for a dedicated portal, where SwAM can make all kinds of information and knowledge on MSP and the planning process available to the parties involved in and concerned by that process.</p>
<p>Describing the Ecosystems, Ecosystem Values, and Valuable and</p>
<p>Vulnerable Areas</p>
<p>SwAM should develop a national system for assessing the values of marine ecosystems, and the effects of human activities on the functioning of the ecosystems, in cooperation with the Government County Offices along the coast and the Marine Environment Institute.</p>
<p>Knowledge of the ecosystem values and the structure and functioning of the ecosystems is fundamental to MSP. In Sweden, there is no comprehensive system to assess the ecosystem values of the marine environment. MSP presupposes that the ecosystem values of different areas and the functioning of the ecosystems can be assessed, in order to consider different claims to use the sea.</p>
<p>A Programme for Sea Related Social and Economic Analysis</p>
<p>SwAM and the Marine Environment Institute should develop and propose a programme to provide the MSP process with sea related social and economic data, in collaboration with Statistics Sweden and other concerned agencies.</p>
<p>The social, economic and interdisciplinary knowledge base for MSP should be developed, as well the methods and the different ways of working involved. The knowledge of sea related attitudes, activities and claims must be improved considerably, in order to allow for social and economic analysis.</p>
<p>The opportunities to collaborate on the Nordic and European level should be seized and developed.</p>
<p>Sectoral Planning Information</p>
<p>The agencies concerned should produce and process relevant information and knowledge within their respective fields of responsibility, in consultation with SwAM, in order to provide the MSP process with the appropriate knowledge base.</p>
<p>It is the opinion of the Commission that the agencies already are required to provide relevant information and knowledge within the framework the existing legislation on the protection of land and sea areas. This is also the case for the implementation of national environmental objectives. This information and knowledge can be adapted to the needs of MSP.</p>
<p>One of the main reasons for MSP is to identify risks and to assess vulnerability and impact. The Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency should provide risk and vulnerability assessments of the activities concerned as a basis for MSP, in collaboration with the coastal Government County Offices and other agencies.</p>
<h2>Proposals on the Use of Data and Information – Providing Knowledge for MSP</h2>
<p>Methods for MSP</p>
<p>The main report of the Commission provides the principles and the overall methods for a new MSP system in Sweden. However, these need to be elaborated and developed by the agencies concerned. The Commission suggests that they should investigate and report on a number of issues:</p>
<p>The Swedish Board of Housing, Building and Planning, together with other agencies and the Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions, should evaluate the implementation of the Planning and Building Act in coastal and sea areas, and propose how the municipal spatial planning of these areas should be improved.</p>
<p>The Government Office in the County of Västra Götaland, in collaboration with the other Offices along the coast, should develop the way the municipal spatial planning process is supervised and handled by the offices, in the context of MSP.</p>
<p>SwAM and the National Planning Board, together with the Marine Environment Institute and other agencies concerned, should develop a research based programme to develop MSP methods and the systems to follow up the planning process.</p>
<p>The Civil Contingencies Agency, together with SwAM, the coastal Government County Offices and the Marine Environment Institute, should develop methods for risk-based planning.</p>
<p>Handle the Consequences of Classified Hydrographical Information</p>
<p>The Armed Forces HQ, in collaboration with SwAM and other agencies, should investigate the consequences for MSP of the fact that certain hydrographical data and information are classified for reasons of national defence, and how these consequences should be handled in the MSP process.</p>
<p>MSP is based on transparency and participation for all parties concerned; municipalities, organisations and the public, as well as neighbouring countries. The fact that certain hydrographical data and information are classified, and the resulting restrictions on their use, may come into conflict with the need for openness in the</p>
<p>planning process, which in certain cases is also required by EU law and international conventions and protocols.</p>
